## Paper Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of image analysis techniques
for classification of the EMNIST dataset, designed for a 10-class classification
task. We introduce a novel ensemble model of existing state-of-the-art CNN
architectures to amplify feature extraction capabilities and achieve well-
generalizable and robust performance on the unseen Kaggle test set. The
ensemble model, comprising VGG-5 and SpinalNet, demonstrates superior
performance compared to each individual model in accuracy. Further,
remarkable alignment with the paperâ€™s reported results on the EMNIST
dataset confirms the fidelity of our model reproduction, underlining the
effectiveness of our tailored approach for the specified classification task.
