"From what I have seen in my neighbourhood, too many people would rather take the chance and risk a parking ticket than pay for parking.  Two green P lots within walking distance of my street (one block and two blocks away) and everything day there's cars parked on the wrong side (it's a one way street) or blocking driveways.  If Toronto wants to raise rates, they should also consider increasing their parking enforcement efforts. 


From the article:

> This fall, Toronto will launch consultations on a citywide parking strategy that could lead to changes in how much real estate the city devotes to stationary vehicles, and how much drivers pay for it.

>The exercise is part of a global trend that has urban centres around the world reconsidering decades-old planning orthodoxy that dictates cities need ample and cheap parking in order to thrive. Proponents of the new philosophy argue that reducing the amount of low-cost parking frees up street space for other public uses, reduces traffic and helps meet climate targets. But any proposal to make parking less readily available and more expensive is sure to provoke pushback from drivers already facing higher costs and business owners struggling to recover from the pandemic

...

>Patrick Siegman, a San Francisco-based transportation planner, said there’s a sea change underway in how cities think about parking. “I have never seen anything like it” in 30 years in the field, he said. “Parking reform is really snowballing.”

...

>In 2022, roughly one-quarter of the parking authority’s 250 off-street lots had peak weekday occupancy rates of at least 85 per cent, the level at which a facility is considered overcapacity and a candidate for higher prices. Rates at most off-street lots range from about $1 to $4 per half-hour.

>Jeff Dea, vice-president of business development at the Toronto Parking Authority, said the agency’s approach is to set prices that are reasonable but high enough to discourage long-term stays, as frequent turnover allows more people to use the spot and shop at local businesses.

>The parking authority typically reviews prices annually at off-street lots and every three years at on-street spots, but because of the pandemic, on-street rates haven’t been increased since 2017. Dea acknowledged rates are now “a little bit low” and the agency will recommend “modest” on-street raises to its board in November. But “we’re not looking at dramatic increases,” he said.",Toronto
"Copenhagen broke ground on their new subway lines at the same time as the Eglinton LRT. Both of their new subway lines are running, despite the fact that construction had to halt many times to call in archeologists. How is it a city of one million is able to construct two subway lines, and a city of five can't finish one fucking LRT.

There need to be punishments in these private-public contracts for failure to complete by a certain date. Levy fines. Don't incentivize them taking longer!! Fucking madness.",Toronto
"I work in big 5 headquarters. Lmao good luck blocking it - PATH is huge and they'll have to block both ground level and underground. And the police knows it better, they know how to navigate TTC tunnels and PATH to get around convoys.

"Be aware that social media is full of trolls and bots as well as thoughtful comments. Fill a thread with racist and hateful comments and it undermines valid concerns shared about our housing shortage exacerbated by a massive surge in non permanent residents. Most comments I see put the blame at the foot of poor governance where it belongs.

It is only by letting politicians know there is a problem that they even begin to take action. We went from a government that was gaslighting Canadians saying the solution to the housing shortage was to increase immigration even more and saying housing is not a federal issue. Then with noise from constituents and a fall in the polls they were having a party retreat focusing on the housing crisis, to finally committing tens of billions on housing subsidies and actually floating the idea of a cap on international students. Now the government can’t actually solve the housing crisis without putting a cap on non permanent residents which is both international students and work permit holders. We will never make up the housing deficit because even with billions in subsidies we can’t double the number of housing starts to meet the current level of demand. Pressure must continue to be put on government until they change course.

"To me the solution is relatively simple. Its hard as fuck as an international student to find accomodations (you can't shop around before you arrive). Each university should build and provide a student residence building that both local and international students can stay in. Cost it at just below market for rent. Students have a reasonable price place to stay, and your international student numbers are capped. International students also know exactly what they're buying into before moving (very easy to find reviews, pictures and testimonials for people who lived in those residences).

Schools already do this for about 10% of their students. They just need to up the number. If these apartments get unused by students one day, we can open them up as low costs ""starter"" units for people just out of high school.",Toronto

It states that if you don’t use the agricultural land for 2 years, meaning you buy land but it sits empty, the government can confiscate it and use it for the benefit of the country. This law exists because Ukraine is an agricultural land and farmers need land because people need to produce & consume food. No compensation is provided if the government seized the land.

I’m not saying we should implement a housing usage law in Canada… But it would be nice if the government could take away an unused property and pay the original purchase price for it, so that the property is being used to house those who need housing. Or maybe force the landlord to accept tenants?

"This is interesting… I can only offer my perspective as a civilian police worker for a large GTA service.   

Sometimes this is all true.  I’ve met a few officers who are just shitty leaders.  They look down on civilian workers and are annoyed with them, yet these are the same kind of people that can’t work an excel document or open a PDF.   Extremely similar to the private sector jokes of how management gets paid more, but lower rung employees do all the work.  They’re cops, they’re supposed to be on the road, not in an office.  

But this isn’t the whole issue.   First off, police civilians have a really sweet deal, with high pay, world class benefits, and air tight job security.  And civilians in leadership roles contribute just as much to abuse and harassment.  I worked as a communicator… my civilian manager was absolute indifferent to… anything.  Other than setting our work schedule, I don’t know what the fuck she did.   Didn’t help when things were busy, gaslit whenever any workplace complaints came up.   

It created an extremely hostile work environment.   The Association would always side with the shitty civilian employees because of insane rules.   I’m talking defending civilians abusing other civilians, sexually, mentally, etc..  And we take it, because we have good pay, good job security, pensions, etc..  we’re always told to be grateful.   

What I’m getting at here is the sense of entitlement among a lot of civilians is completely out of control, and sometimes it’s easier to blame the uniform side of things.  I’ve seen civilians flaunt their workplace out in public (I work for the cops, give me this!).   It’s simply not one sided, I’m just saying I’ve seen it all in my time there.

Most of the officers I worked with were pretty good with me, but you had the odd one who just didn’t care for civilians.     Frankly, in my time there, civilians were much worse.",Toronto

"Long story time:

Just over a year ago, I signed a lease on a new place and I got permission from my old landlord to gradually spend about a week moving all my stuff, bit by bit. So every day, I would move another load, and do some preliminary organizing in the new place (put some books on shelves, hang some clothes in the closet etc), and then lock up and bring the moving bins back to my old place to refill another load for the next day.

This is relevant because, while I was sleeping in my old place each night, all of my stuff (more and more of it each day) was lying there in the new place which, I had yet to learn, was absolutely teeming with a bed bug infestation.

On my final day of moving, I locked up the old place for the last time around midnight and brought my last few things over, to settle in for my first sleep in my brand new bed (at least it was new to me - the place came pre-furnished from the previous tenant, which turned out to be the whole crux of the problem). 

So I got into bed and turned out the light to go to sleep, with my phone charging on the pillow beside me. Just as I was closing my eyes, the phone just happened to light up with a notification and as I looked over, I caught what looked like a little dot scurrying across the screen. Thinking it might be a spider or something, I quickly sat up and turned the light on - just in time to see literally DOZEN UPON DOZENS of tiny dots scattered across the headboard and my pillows. Swarming is the only word to describe it. I knew immediately what they were and I leapt out of the bed in abject horror.

I tore off my pajamas and put on the first fresh clothes I could grab from the most recent bag I had brought over, grabbed only my wallet, phone and my keys, and booked it from the house. I walked several blocks in shock before finally flagging down a taxi. (I don't really know what else I could have done, but I forever hope that none of the little buggers hitched a ride into that cab with me.) I fled straight to my partner's place and as soon as I got in the door, stripped fully naked again, putting all the clothes I had been wearing directly into a double sealed garage bag, and then showered for what seemed like hours.

The next day I managed to break my lease, thank goodness, and the landlord (who swore he had no idea...) let me move all my belongings into his garage for the day, to sort through them, while he brought fumigators into the apartment to try to salvage the place before looking for a new tenant. I spent 18 hours on the concrete floor of the garage, sorting everything I own into ""laundry/quarantine/trash"" categories. By the end of that night I had officially moved in with my partner. (I stored everything I moved outside on his balcony in double sealed bins wrapped in garbage bags until they could be fully treated). 

The funny thing about all this was that we had fully intended to move in together anyway, but when I had had to suddenly move out of my original place, w",Toronto

>Rents can vary widely in the province, with longtime tenants in rent-controlled apartments often holding on to relatively affordable places. In Ontario, there’s rent control for buildings occupied before 2018, but when a new tenant comes in, the landlord can charge whatever they like. So when renters move, they face big increases, and a black hole of information about what their neighbours are paying.

Having more (voluntary) transparency with things such as rent can help people who are otherwise operating in the dark on these matters. Maybe this can help also with some of the worst of the behaviors of some landlords in relation to their tenants.

"I’m someone who went to Ryerson/TMU in recent years to study engineering but had visited the area often many years before that, in the late 20-aughts when AMC was still there.

I think personally, one of the things that caused the place to be less interesting over the years on top of concerts, was the fact that the desire to visit the area around there has decreased dramatically.

Case in point, retail and the rise of Amazon.

Even I can remember Sam, just north of Yonge at Gould, it may have closed in 2007, but the HMV and Sunrise lasted nearly a decade longer. These were flagship stores that had a large selection you couldn’t find elsewhere.

The entire state of Yonge just immediately north of Dundas to about Gerrard is awfully depressing now, the pandemic is widely responsible, but it still has shown no signs of recovering. It’s somewhat ironic, that the Ryerson SLC is arguably the most interesting thing there now in that stretch.

"Original OP here. 

The headline is really funny to me. Who are they apologizing to? It can't be me -- Metro never responded to my complaint (I submitted my concern through their website's ""food safety complaint"" webform on Monday). I haven't even been offered a refund.

It's also interesting how Metro's story has evolved. When the CFIA called them on Wednesday, the CFIA was told someone ""likely"" forgot to change the price labelling gun, resulting in the error. Yes, CFIA's investigation concluded that same day based on a phone call with the store about what ""likely"" happened. CFIA then backed down because ""human error at the retail level"" falls more-so under the mandate of Toronto Public Health, and told me to contact TPH if I want them to investigate (the media picking up the story seems to have since led CFIA to look more closely). 

However, once I finally got through with Metro (Friday), I was told ""there's no way for us to know it was or what exactly happened"". So how could they explain this away with any legitimacy as *human error at the retail level* to CFIA on Wednesday? How can you have any confidence it was an error if you don't know who did it or why? Why would a claim of human error over the phone be sufficient to end CFIA investigation?

Anyway, by way of update, I have been told by Metro that the store will retrain its meat department staff and that CFIA and TPH ""have been in and are happy"". TPH never responded to my forwarded complaint on Wednesday, and CFIA has not been in contact since saying the investigation was concluded based on their Wednesday call to the store, so perhaps both entities investigated my complaint further -- or perhaps Metro is mislabeling what happened, again.",Toronto

**Written by**: Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss
  
**Director**: Lucy Moss and Jamie Armitage
  
**Actors**: Jaz Robinson, Julia Pulo, Maggie Lacasse, Krystal Hernández, Elysia Cruz and Lauren Mariasoosay
  
**Company**: Mirvish Productions
  
**Venue**: Royal Alexandra Theatre
  
**City**: Toronto
  
**Year**: Runs to Dec. 17, 2023
  
Critic’s pick
  

  
Long live the Queens!
  

  
After a brief stop at Edmonton’s Citadel Theatre, the Canadian production of Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss’s Tony Award-winning musical about Henry VIII’s ill-fated wives has finally arrived in Toronto. And with any luck, this royal visit should last a good long time – well beyond its current Dec. 17 closing date.
  

  
Written by the British duo when they were students at Cambridge University for the 2017 Edinburgh Fringe, Six has reigned supreme wherever it’s played: the West End, Australia, Broadway (after a pre-Broadway run that included the aforementioned Citadel) and elsewhere.
  

  
And no wonder. Six’s songs are catchy, its message of female empowerment and solidarity inspiring and its lighting design, costumes and choreography as eye-poppingly fun as anything at a girl-group pop concert.
  

  
Never pretending to be a dramatically engaging piece of theatre, Six leans into its stadium-show concept. Its characters even joke about it, saying they’re “live in consort.” At the top, they strut out onstage, holding microphones and exclaiming, “How ya doing, Toronto?!” – as if this is one stop on their Tudors tour.
  

  
The conceit is that the six monarchs – who early on repeat that gruesome classroom verse about them being “divorced, beheaded, died; divorced, beheaded, survived” – have returned from their graves to crown one of them the leader of the band. It’s up to the audience to vote for the winner. And by winner, they mean the most maligned and ill-used by history.
  

  
And so, in chronological order and backed up by their all-female band (their rockin’ “ladies in waiting”), the queens present their cases.
  

  
Open this photo in gallery:
  
Julia Pulo, centre left, brings a vivid personality and impeccable comic timing to the role of Anne Boleyn.

Should the winner be the imperious, devout Catherine of Aragon (Jaz Robinson), who was married to Henry’s older brother at 15 before being passed along to him like some possession? Or should it be Anne Boleyn (Julia Pulo), she of the infamous decapitation, who made England break with the Catholic Church? Or what about Jane Seymour (Maggie Lacasse), allegedly the only one of his wives that Henry truly loved?
  

  
The songs are Six’s crown jewels: There’s a reason why the show won the Tony for best score and why its various cast albums have broken records for downloads and streams. Marlow and Moss have cleverly written numbers that simultaneously tell you about the characters belting them out and act as homages to past and present rulers of contemporary pop ",Toronto

There was one bog with no light for all three flats. Our front room in the flat was also the bathroom and kitchen and the other room was divided into two bedrooms by a hardboard partition. No heating! The entire street was like that but our house was called the white house because we were literally the only white people in the street.  It was glourious chaos - the pub was full of fucked up people who worked their arses off in mainly manual jobs and the highlight of the evening was slipping some acid in some poor old gits beer and watch him start throwing bricks through people's windows.

Whole streets were squatted (there is a great storey about Ellingfort Road but that was later on) - lots and lots of hash being sold, loads of Anarcho Punks, Hippies, Dreads, quite a large gay scene, Lowlife parties (almost a forerunner of the rave scene) - it was colourful, mad and just the right side of scary.

"- know the quickest way to change lines at Green Park and Victoria tubes (aka not doing what the signs tell you)

- been evacuated by the cops from a whole street because of a terrorist alert, and instead of being scared being mildly annoyed because you wanted to go to pret 

- gone on a riverboat and being full of joy and wonder, thinking 'I should do this more often/I could commute this way/London is so beautiful on the river' and then not getting on another boat for at least 12 months 

- celebrated a heatwave by going to a pub (to stand outside the pub) every night after work for the whole week 

- got caught up by football fans, either on a crazy packed tube, foreign fans letting off smoke bombs and causing a station to be evacuated, having to get off a bus which had stopped because of celebrating fans blocking the road. Somehow these things become common occurrences and you end up shrugging your shoulders 

- really looking forward to an event but then thinking you can't be bothered because it's raining and you'll never get a cab, and don't want to take public transport because your feet will hurt

More colourful street culture. Punks, goths, ageing hippies, at least they dressed flamboyantly. Now it's black puffer jackets and trainers as far as the eye can see.

Housing was shitter and cheaper. I knew a young artist who had a one bed flat in Fitzrovia on housing benefit. Hard to imagine now, but that flat hadn't been renovated in 20 years back then. The first flat my aunt bought at the end of the 70s didn't even have an inside loo yet.

No-one picked up dog shit, but there were way fewer dogs. 

Mechanical parking meters lining the streets.

"Problem is, to make housing more affordable you likely reduce current homeowners equity and current homeowners are more likely to be voters (I.e. older/Boomers)

If prices come down, interest rates will climb further undoubtedly, our recent 'historic lows' have had to be because of the prices. If those come down and interest rates rise, Millenials on the ladder could have the double whammy of Negative Equity and Spiraling interest rates, leaving them unable to sell and unable to afford their mortgages.

Some people agreed and said they suck (the majority), some people dissed me and said I’m doing it wrong because they’re skewed and favour women. As an introvert and an Indian immigrant - it’s ridiculously hard and I think it’s easier for anyone who’s white or British. Men on dating apps want someone who “doesn’t take themselves seriously” (whatever that means) and a travel partner (I have an Indian passport and I can’t go anywhere without a visa - my exposure to travel has obviously been limited because of where I’m from and my personal circumstances). They want someone who knows what they want but 90% of the men I see on dating apps in their 30s say they don’t know what they’re looking for. I’m not ugly but I’m not extremely hot. I’m working on my mental and my physical health and dating apps make me feel like shit. I don’t expect a lot (before someone attacks me for saying I expect too much). In my previous relationships in India, I’ve made more than my partners and I’ve been okay with that. I’m at a loss of where to go from here and may just have to be okay with spending the rest of my life alone. As a south Asian 30 year old woman, I’m insecure and I’m an introvert - I have abandonment issues and this thread has made me even more anxious. Everytime I’m on it now it makes me so anxious and ends up with me feeling like I’m never going to be enough. Last week I matched with someone on a dating app who was British brown and I think he unmatched with me because of how I sounded - unsure if it was my voice or my accent. I always try to be the bigger person, I went on a date with someone who wanted to see me and I didn’t so I apologised and dropped him a text, I didn’t even get a response even though it made me anxious to type it out. At this point, I’d rather spend money I would spend on apps or men on a physical trainer and therapy bills.

In cases like this it’s almost always an errant appliance that is using way more than you though (or neighbour/landlord shenanigans) 

The best thing to do is unplug everything, except one appliance and take a meter reading 3-5 mins apart. Repeat this for your appliances and you will discover what if anything is draining your power.

I've been looking through tik tok mental health and have hit some emotional moments as I find something that relates to what I'm going through or having some type of ""breakthrough"". I have ADHD and have pretty wild mood swings, maybe some characteristics of Borderline Personality Disorder as well. It's not a fun time when I'm triggered. I'm also going through a pretty tough breakup at the moment. It's extremely painful that the person that caused me alot of my current pain was the one that opened up a lot of childhood wounds and that allowed myself to actually want to start trying to put the work in to becoming a better person. I learned setting boundaries and what I will and will not put up with in a relationship moving forward. I learned about my emotions and what triggers the tornado inside of my head. Dealing with that is so difficult. People are either put in your life to teach you some very important lessons or they're put there to be by your side. Start learning about money now, if you haven't.

In a women I usually try and look for someone who enjoys doing the same things as me but is able to appreciate and enjoy things outside of their comfort zone, something I get to see with time. Honestly if I see someone’s profile and it looks like their personality revolves around drinking, despite myself loving a night out I know we are probably not compatible cos I’m not a big drinker at all. 

It’s funny because on dating apps a lot of women don’t really put any effort into showing who they actually are, which I understand because for the most part men are visual creatures so why make the effort you may ask, some of us actually care and are motivated to find connection beyond purely physical attraction (as it’s something I’ve already done and realised it’s not what longevity is built on)

Despite living in SLondon I rarely get suggested black women’s profiles especially on hinge. It’s not like I don’t find black women attractive so I don’t know why my algorithm is behaving that way. It definitely exists because they ask about race and it builds an idea of your compatibility.

4) yes. But I'm black and have never dated a black woman so technically, I've only dated other races. That's is largely because of me more than black women. Black women in London are just culturally and personality wise very different, I can't even understand black people dialect in London because of my upbringing. I was kept off the streets. I am a deathcore and melodeath fan that plays video games and lives for rugby, American football and Millwall. There's not many black people in my idk how you say but like group of mutual interest people. You know how in school we had goths emos grungers etc. I was nowhere near the chavs or the roadmen.

Sometimes the noise coming through walls/floorboards projects louder for the person on the receiving end than it does for the unsuspecting noise-creator. So that could be the case, or she might just have a stick up her a$$.   I used to live in an area with a lot of kids and families, and there was an unspoken rule that noise levels needed to be reduced after 11pm (unless it’s a birthday/event and you’ve let everyone know in advance), and before 9am on weekends, but 7pm on a Saturday is a bit much… good luck my friend ??",London
"I’m a woman in my mid forties a little over weight and not mainstream attractive. I go onto apps knowing it will be difficult. I also have strong opinions about certain subjects. I avoid matching with men who are too attractive, men who’s blurb makes them sound like fuckwits, men who’s politics or religious beliefs clash with mine. That gives me a very small pool. Out of which even less match with me too. As a result I go on extraordinarily few dates. But that’s fine.

I do have to agree though with one commenter. This conversation always seems to be geared around how men behave on dating apps, never the other way around. Pretty much everything you've just said applies in reverse. 

Mostly I just think.. if you don't like online dating, don't do it. If you don't like how certain people approach online dating, don't engage with them. I completely understand it's frustrating (we all do) but it is what it is at the end of the day.",London
"Hi all
  

  
Just a quick question ive been looking to purchase tickets for the London 2023 fireworks for new years but cant seem to figure it out.

"1. It's exhausting to be constantly putting oneself out there and being genuine about wanting to make a connection only to find out the other person is looking for attention or wants to play games. There's definitely a factor of just hitting the numbers with dating until you find something that clicks, but I feel like people aren't willing to be as genuine anymore and so nothing ever really feels like it goes anywhere.

2. Easier to have options on hand if people don't get invested or aren't genuine, if things don't work with one there's always another.

3. Someone who puts in the effort to themselves and whomever else they're seeing. If I'm showing up I'm saying you're worth my time to get to know you better and try and start something, reciprocity of that would be nice. Being hot does not override having no personality.

4. Yes, but to your second one, no. I think some cultures are more similar than others and the cultural experience or gap with black women for me is just a bit too wide to bridge.",London

"What's ""normal"" is for landlords to ban pets outright. So most renters never encounter this scenario.

You are lucky to have found a landlord that permits your dog at all. As a dog owner I don't find this clause unreasonable - the longer you leave a dog alone, the more likely it is to engage in antisocial behaviour. If you're as attentive a dog owner as you claim the clause would not be hard to comply with.  If I can't be with my dog for several hours, I find someone else to be with him, or I lodge him with family or friends for however long it takes.

"My take and it's just my opinion. 

East has plenty of gangs, South too. Lots of young people with no real opportunity or chance to improve their lives. They turn to a culture where it is possible to make quick cash with drugs and violence.

The problem is this current sink or swim mentality, we all have the same chances, doesn't work for marginalised communities. They need additional help and support but the white population are not willing to accept and provide additional support to help support people in poverty. So the cycle continues. There is also a problem of absent fathers which typically leads to an impoverished upbringing. Without that family/ father/ support, again the cycle of poverty continues. There is a really easy fix but this country would rather spend billions on a train line they can't deliver than support  marginalised communities in poverty, to help people. I know people don't want handouts, I am not suggesting that. Simply better support, education opportunities, free uni, proper childcare, etc.",London

"Here's the thing. Mobile phones contain a lot of valuable materials in them.

Even if you just considered gold (of which your phone contains about £1.80 worth), if you were to process a tonne of phones, you'd get 300 times more gold than processing s tonne of gold ore, because the gold in the phone is already purified.

If opportunistic thieves are willing to nick a £5 steak to flog for a few quid they are also going to be willing to nick a phone even if it's just for the literal value of the metals. 

As things stand though the phones are either used overseas where the police and networks don't care and manufacturers can't stop them, or they are broken down for parts and sold to ""repair shops"" or literally chop shopped like a car and then sold. 

Maybe theoretically if you make the phone totally useless apart from the value of the metals if it was stolen it will discourage gangs from stealing phones en mass. I'm not convinced that's possible though and if it was it could double the price of your phone.",London

I have asked for service to be removed where it has been really bad and only once did it cause any problem.

"More houses built or less money in the market is what needs to happen

We could reduce demand by taxing investment houses, second houses, etc more than primary residence. As an example, if your house is a 'second home' then you can pay a multiple of the normal council tax",London
"Agree with most of the sensible suggestions in this thread. The reality is that crashing the housing market and reducing house prices by 50% overnight will cause more economic problems than it would solve housing issues. 

Therefore any approach should be focused around three things:

1) bringing stability to housing prices. If people know that a 350k house will still be worth 350k in two years time that helps when it comes to savings and planning. This has to come through increasing the supply, either through more house building or making it less attractive to own empty properties.

2) restrict predatory activities by landlords - limit rental increases to inflation, stricter policies around repairs etc., no no fault evictions

3) make non-housing purchase costs cheaper for young buyers. E.g., I'd suggest making stamp duty payable at the point of sale rather than purchase. That guarantees zero stamp duty for first time buyers, and means those who benefit most from house price inflation pay their fair share. Introduce a rental properties purchaae tax to keep higher costs on buying property to rent out. Maybe also set up a subsidised conveyancing service for FTB as well to help with those costs.",London

"Like many things a HEAVY separation from companies to what should be the people's resource.

IDK know a lot about how housing works but:

Restrictions on how many homes a single person can own and buy, all houses must be brought under a name not a company.  
Company owned living facilities like hotels must be built/converted from non housing structures. 

A Cap on house value and rent per square meter, while also gutting out any middle men who inflate house building costs though laws.

Change the way houses are valued, everyone needs a place to live regardless of its location.  
It should be valued for what it is and its condition, not locations, views etc.

Unoccupied homes will be taxed for future government build projects, landlords can choose to reliquish their property if they are unable to sell it, this is where future build projects can take over to renovate and sell/rent to further add to their own funding.

The cost of rent will be based on maintenance of the property only, paying to *occupy a* property is worthless since it would be taxed otherwise.

Exploits in the housing market will be monitored by an independant body so house costs remain low to protect the people, repeated offenders will lose the property/ies involved and be taken over by future build projects.

"The Wetherspoons just off Trafalgar Square on Whitehall. I went in for convenience at one point as you usually know what you’re getting. Massively reduced menu, hugely increased prices. Had the fish and chips - two small pieces of dry, breaded fish with thin French fries. It was weird.",London
"I am also in need of info from this situation. Seems like its 50/50 being a panic from the Paris infestation and social media. And a problem that has just been always in London but nobody talked about it until now (also post-pandemic travelling has increased).

"Met my partner on Hinge! I had been single a year after a long term relationship. Had dated during that year but wasn’t overly keen on getting into anything serious and enjoyed being alone - met him and it was just so easy that everything just clicked!

"It’s simple, installed home cctv system that records your activity and those of your neighbour. As long as it is in your home and filming inside it is fine, make sure audio is active.

I am now convinced there is a guy call Ron out the back cooking all the burgers.

"People are taking advice from strangers who are advising others not to look desperate. I have seen a comment suggesting not to message back for a day. 

The type of women I’d seek would be like my girlfriend someone who is easy to get a long with doesn’t bring drama, is fun and loving and calm. I’m dating interracially as my girlfriend is Asian.",London
"I think this really depends on which neighbourhood your in and what time of day it is.

Eg1 - central london weekday. No issues, mostly tourists 
Central london - Saturday 11pm - you’ll have loads of drunk people, singing and/or shouting, people eating McDonald’s 

Eg2 - neighbourhood popular with young families like Clapham.
3-5pm, expect the bus to be swarming with kids in school uniform, probably laughing, messing about,
Playing music etc.
9am - 3pm - that same bus won’t even be half full,
Mums with their prams and people helping them, older residents etc, all very calm and considerate 

TLDR - it all depends - time and location are everything",London
"I agree that the UK is bad but let’s not exaggerate Rome is MUCH worse. There’s rubbish everywhere in some places. And it’s not just bottles, there’s clothes and all sorts of things. Sometimes even chairs or other large items. It’s a mess.

Ultimately, the problem is do with our culture. People simply don’t care. They think it’s acceptable. It’s not something we’ll able to change anytime soon unless we put much more effort into enforcing it. I’d start by introducing extremely high fines for littering. We also need to make sure that more people get fined. Aside from that, we need to educate people more.",London
"They also need to keep cases open. The police often close them because in that moment they can't determine who stole your phone.

But like serial killers it can take multiple victims before they track them down, they wouldn't close the case just because of the first murder wasnt solved",London
"How many dates have you been on in the last 6 months? 

I got to a point where I realised I need to work hard to get good results. Like anything in life.  

So, I went on a mission to date, and if they aren’t ideal, date someone else asap, repeat the cycle over and over. 

Then, months later, I went on a date with this girl who lived further away than anyone I’d dated yet (I opened up my radius - you should too). 

She was great to talk to and a lovely girl. A bit more ‘wholesome’, older and nerdy than who I’d usually dated.   In fact the older point is key. She was miles more mature than other younger girls.

Anyway, I wasn’t really feeling it for the first date or two but it did click and we are still together, just bought a house.  

It took hard work to get through enough people to meet someone nice though.",London

"Me and my girlfriend met at the Battersea Power station opening as we’d both gone to visit it alone. We ended up spending all night together just chatting and drinking. Somehow once the night had finished she wasn’t sure if I was into her and was reluctant to see me for a bit.

"M (38), hear me out on M&S. Underwear and basics like plain coloured T-shirts. They wash really well and fit like a glove. I've got vests from there that I've been wearing everyday for 5+ years and are still looking good. A bit faded from washing but still comfortable and warm. Worth the spend IMO. I hear you on the outerwear though. I feel like a kid playing dress up when I try on some of their clothes.",London

* Games - you buy tokens, don't remember the cost, each game uses a set number of tokens

* Vibe - again, work do around christmas so who knows what it will be like now but loud, packed, nice vibe I guess but just... busy.",London

Absolument détestables aussi, après leur avoir demandé de baisser le ton (gentiment hein) j'ai reçu des insultes en retour. Perplexe, je demande au resto de s'imposer parce que ça gênait non seulement moi mais tout le monde aussi qui se retournait vers eux avec une grimace. Evidemment le restaurant n'a rien pu faire.

Mais je ne savais pas si je pouvais l'utiliser aussi pour un bus à l'intérieur de Paris pour rejoindre une gare RER -- par exemple prendre la ligne 26 en direction de la Gare du Nord, ensuite le RER à l'aéroport. Ou faudrait-il un ticket T+ pour le bus et un autre billet RER?

"Just to help in your search, was it a flea market which we call 'brocante' or did it look like a regular thing with a mix of food, clothing, etc. Was it indoor or outdoor (they apparently have both there)? 

I'm asking because a flea market/brocante is usually 90% old objects, clothing, furniture, sold by both pros and a few amateurs or neighbors. And this type of marché is only occasional, like 4-5 times a year. At least in my neighborhood, there's an open air market twice a week, but I rarely see the brocante type.

Sinon,  je dois dire que je serais très heureux s'ils nous donnaient vraiment une alternative aux tickets carton, mais là pour tous les gens qui vont régulièrement en banlieue (donc la plupart des gens) c'est juste une carte de plus à posséder tout en continuant à se trimbaler des tickets, je vois vraiment pas l'intérêt de ce changement.

"If someone in Paris is looking at you weird, I’d say the person is a tourist. Natives in big cities will look at you doing stuff and honestly just think “they’re enjoying themselves, how nice”, because they know everyone are busy and can’t always hang out in groups. 

Suburbs are small communities and could be seen as a smaller town, with a different mentality than where you are from. Depending on the area I’d say that some people really won’t care if you’re doing stuff alone.

Mis à part le loyer (pas tellement plus cher qu’ailleurs dans Paris) et l’appart pourri que j’occupe, j’ai l’impression d’en avoir fait un peu le tour. Il y a beaucoup, beaucoup de touristes, toute l’économie est tournée vers eux.

C’est difficile de circuler dans certaines rues piétonnes (rue de Buci…) tant il y a de monde. Les autochtones appartiennent principalement à la grande bourgeoisie, pas spécialement le milieu que je préférerais côtoyer, même si mes moyens me le permettaient. Le quartier autrefois populaire et artistique vit de son image, alors qu’il est devenu l’opposé de ce qu’il était à l’époque qui l’a rendu célèbre : les artistes ont laissé la place aux marchands d’art, les petits commerces ou salles de spectacle aux boutiques de luxe à la con.

"Nous étions vendredi et je quittais tranquillement Paris après une grosse journée. La rame était plutôt bondée mais rien d'anormal sur le RER B aux heures de pointe. Nous arrivons à la station Cité Universitaire et pour ceux qui n'auraient pas la ref, la station est particulièrement mal foutue et l'espace entre le train et le quai peut être indécent à certains endroits.   


Pas mal de personnes descendent à cette station et soudainement une mini panique démarre. Je ne comprends pas tout de suite ce qu'il se passe mais je finis par remarquer que plusieurs personnes tentent de récupérer quelque chose dans l'espace entre le train et le quai. Je retire mon casque et capte des bouts de phrases qui me font comprendre que ce quelque chose est en vérité un ENFANT. Plusieurs personnes tendent les bras dans l'espoir de le récupérer en vain. La hauteur du quai par rapport aux rails est plutôt haute et l'enfant avait dans les 3 ans, donc il ne devait pas être assez grand pour prendre les mains qu'on lui tendait. Je suppose de plus que vu son jeune âge, il devait plus être en train de pleurer et d'être en panique totale plutôt que d'agir de manière optimale pour se sortir de cette situation (à raison, encore une fois, il est très jeune).  


La personne que j'avais identifié comme le père (c'était la personne la plus visiblement paniquée) finit par sauter de lui-même sur les rails pour récupérer son bambin. Au même moment, la sonnerie de fermeture des portes retentit et une personne à proximité des leviers d'urgence en actionne enfin un, permettant d'assurer que le RER n'allait pas repartir et causer un grave accident.   


L'enfant est récupéré, il est en vie et ne semble avoir aucune blessure physique. Par contre, ça lui promet un bon traumatisme. Bref, l'histoire finit tout de même bien, ça aurait pu clairement être pire. J'espère que cet enfant va bien et que cet incident ne l'impactera pas trop négativement dans sa prise future des transports en commun.",Paris

"I don't know about these two but some context: France (and most of Europe) does not really have PhD programs in the sense it exists in the Anglo world (well it does but it's a recent thing and there are not many). Most PhD students are on a specific project with a specific supervisor. So as a PhD student, the exact institution you are affiliated to is kind of an administrative detail, what you really care about is the research unit your supervisor is in. And since the landscape of French academic institutions is horribly complicated, with many structures being included into each other or overlapping in complex ways, the relationship between where you actually work and who you actually work with on the one hand, and what institutions you are affiliated to on the other hand can get murky.

Anyway, it's not clear from your post what stage you're at. If you are interested in working at a specific unit, you should contact some researchers there and ask about funding opportunities. If you just want ""a PhD from Polytechnique"" you are thinking about it wrong, this is not how French universities work. There is no reason to limit yourself to particular institutions, you should be looking at the specific research units and supervisors for each offer. It helps if you can get in contact with academics in the field you are interested in to get pointers.",Paris

Alors beaucoup de commentaires sont à mon avis beaucoup trop biaisés. On voit que le sub est rempli de Parisien qui n'ont jamais passé le periph.

Auber n'est pas un coupe gorge en fait, front pop, la mairie et le fort sont des endroits globalement OK. Les clichés sur la seine St Denis ont la vie dure.

Auber est une des villes qui va le plus profiter du grand paris et des JO avec de grandes transformations : rénovation de jean jaurès, rénovation du canal st Denis, piscine olympique au fort, 2 stations de la ligne 15,  3 quartiers rénovés avec la NPRU, (rénovation urbaine de l'état). Eco quartier du fort d’Aubervilliers et de la gare de Pantin, le secteur sera transformé dans 10 ans.

Cela dit, les 4 chemins sont un quartier à part et vraiment pas très agréable à fortioti pour une femme.C'est un quartier très dense avec des marchands de sommeil, ce qui fait que les gens restent souvent dehors à zoner parce que chez eux c'est petit et insalubre.

"Some quick math:

2,000,000 - people in Paris |
500,000 - 25% between 20 - 35 |
100,000 - conservative estimate that 1 in 5 are single |
50,000 - men |
50,000 - women |
35,000 - 70% are men on dating apps |
20,000 - 40% women are on dating apps 

So is this to say you have 1/35k odds of just even appearing in the card stack for the entire city of Paris?

And I that population estimate is lower than official one and probably excludes people passing through.There are also paid users who appear first (apparently).

Then, there's the matter of there being far more men chasing fewer women, so naturally they have many options.

At least with Hinge, it is more direct than the likes of Tinder where you can see who likes you but you'll still be in a large queue especially for good looking women who will be flooded with likes and messages.

Being seen
Liked
Match
Message

Like 2000€ fast for a qualifier round of whatever obscure sport high, let alone athletism or swimming. Cool disciplines in cool places, like fencing in Grand Palais, or track running in Stade de France, was basically out of reach.

In July, we have reached the phase where you can buy individual sports. But that doesn't change the fact that tickets are not available. The organization said there'd be a resell platform with caped price to avoid scalping. But this Olympics, marketed like a people's event, is already a shitshow for not being accessible, you know, by the people..

"Frenchman here, currently living in Paris! Great initiative!

The following advice comes from 12 years of traveling the world, living, studying and working in multiple countries, meeting Americans in the US and elsewhere, tourists and expatriates alike, in a very diverse set of situations, as well as discussing their behavior online and with my friends.

From my own understanding of the usual stereotypes associated with American tourists, it is more of a **behavioral issue** than anything. The main ones are:

**1. Being obnoxious (speaking loudly) / attention-seeking behaviors.**

Discretion and a ""Less is more"" philosophy are considered to be ""polite"", ""elegant"" and ""chic"" behaviors. That is even more the case in places of cultural and historical relevance. 

But that also works for hotels and restaurants, the subway/bus, or any public place.

**2. Acting untitled, like you own the place. Lacking self-awareness about your behavior. Not trying to adapt or understand other countries' cultures.**

""When in Rome, do as the Romans do"".

The latter usually comes from a lack of understanding and education about the culture in question. Understanding a country's culture takes years of both living in the country, and speaking its language fluently. You cannot google that or watch a YouTube tutorial. It's a great start and means your mindset is in the right place, but it's not enough, especially when talking about cultures that have thousands of years of history and traditions. You don't learn that in days, weeks, or even months.

**So, my best advice is to remain ""lowkey"", to be respectful, and curious, and to stay humble in the face of your own ignorance. It's normal to not fully comprehend another culture. Just don't act like you do.**

That's what I've always applied for myself in any country I've visited or lived in, and it always worked wonders.

**3. Expecting everybody to speak English and not making any effort to speak a few words of French. When your students speak English, they should do so slowly, and articulately.**

Most French people over the age of 40 (and even under) would struggle to understand an American person speaking at a ""normal"" pace (for a native speaker). If they can even understand you at all. It's improving in big French cities, but it's better not to expect it, and then be pleasantly surprised when your waiter happens to speak fluently rather than to expect everybody to adapt to you, and be disappointed.

Don't make it sound like you're speaking to a child either. Body language is universal when it comes to that sort of thing.

**Also, ""Customer is king"" is a very misunderstood belief that I see a lot (I've studied Marketing, for the record). It should rather be ""A Good Customer is King""**: France has been the most visited country in the world for about the past 30 consecutive years. The French restaurants do not need ""shitty customers"" from other countries, they already have plenty. Being a kind and respectful customer inste",Paris

"J'en ai subi des dingueries dans les transports, mais il y en a une qui m'a vraiment traumatisée et à laquelle je repense encore souvent alors que ça s'est passé en 2016. Je préfère prévenir que l'histoire qui va suivre est NSFW.

2016 donc, en plein été. Avec mon mec de l'époque et une copine, on a prévu de s'envoler pour l'Espagne. On prend donc le métro de Lille pour se rendre à l'aéroport dans la joie et la bonne humeur. Un homme et son fils entrent dans le métro et commencent à râler parce que nos valises lui bloquent le passage. Ni une ni deux, on les déplace pour leur permettre de passer, mais cela ne calme pas le monsieur. Il commence à nous insulter, et moi plus particulièrement (vous savez, le genre d'insultes sexistes et dégradantes qu'on entend souvent quand on est une femme en robe d'été dans le métro). 

Nous on est trop contents de partir en Espagne alors on ne fait pas gaffe à ce gars qui continue de nous insulter avec son fils d'une douzaine d'années, on laisse couler et je lui tourne le dos. On passe à autre chose, on discute une dizaine de minutes, et tout d'un coup ma pote regarde par-dessus mon épaule et son visage se décompose. Je me retourne pour voir ce qui la trouble, et là, je vois le mec en train de se masturber à quelques centimètres de moi. Il était le chibre à l'air, en train de se branler compulsivement en me regardant droit dans les yeux, avec une haine indescriptible. Et son gamin était là, à le regarder comme si tout était normal, bien tranquille, pas choqué pour un sous, ce qui m'a fait penser qu'il avait souvent vu son père faire ça devant lui...

Le pire c'est que cette scène nous a tellement choqué qu'on a rien su dire. On a changé de rame de métro, laissant le petit tout seul avec son cinglé de père. Je m'en veux beaucoup de n'avoir pas eu de réflexe. J'aurais pu changer la vie de ce pauvre gosse si j'avais appelé la police, mais je crois que j'étais trop sidérée pour réagir correctement.",Paris

"I’m in my mid 40s and grew up around. I played there all my childhood and we always looked in the grass for syringes before sitting/lying/playing there. I witnessed more than my share of weird shits over the years. Then the village happened and it was a great thing for the gay community. It also brought the first wave of gentrification. 

Poor people were pushed est, but there was still room for the descendants of “Le faubourg à m’lasse”, and the safety it gave to the gay community was a necessity, and one of the great thing that happened to the neighborhood.

And then 10-15 years ago started the new French wave. Fed up of the Plateau and rising prices, the settled in droves, putting more pressure on the historically poor people move est. Then 5-8 years ago, anglophones number started going up. Plates from Ontario and New-York. Not just around the village, but in all the neighborhoods. The pressure to move est continued, but even the areas around Frontenac and Hochelaga were being gentrified. At the same time Airbnb, and house flippers continued chasing the population away. 

But there was nowhere else to go when you are dirt poor. So you stay with friends, family and drug friends. Then the pandemic broke those links and people ended up in the streets. 

Now, where do mentally Ill people go? What do you do when you’ve been cast away from your homes? There used to be “crack houses” every few other streets, male and female prostitutes splitting saint-catherine and Ontario. Now those people are still alive, they just don’t have a roof or people from their network around anymore. 

And now the situation has reverted. The balance that somewhat existed in the 2000-2018 era gave way to the current situation that gets worst by the year. Not as bad as the nineties, (Hells angels vs rock machines, skinheads and Co.)but still pretty bad. It’s sad. We need to invest again in the communal kitchens, make sure people can have a roof and accept that addicts will always be there. Better to reduce the harm than fight them. These people have as much right as we do to live in this city. 

If we chase them away from their houses, we should really advocate for serious investments in social housing. Every house flipped should contribute. Every new buyers who move in a historically rental neighbourhood should pay an extra for public/low income housing.

Leaves House (a couple of locations) is an all vegan coffee shop with delicious vegan pastries. Recommend les danoise aux bleuets, blueberry danish. Amazing. We were in Montreal for a week and went there at least 3 times.

Burger Fiancé. Vegan burgers and other fast food style stuff. We didn't try their homemade burgers because they contain walnuts (allergic), but their fried vegan chicken sandwiches were amazing. They can swap in impossible burgers, and I tried their ""Double Date,"" and it was awesome. Highlight was the kimchi fries. We went there twice during our trip.

Last but not least is Bloom Sushi. All vegan sushi. We went there our last night and regret not going sooner since we would have loved to return. Absolutely fantastic food across the board. We ordered something like 9 sushi rolls and were absolutely stuffed and happy. Highly recommended.

Additionally, we got food at Copper Branch (pretty good), Umami Ramen (very good), and Conceria (delicious vegan Italian, owned by the Burger Fiancé folks).

Curious to know if the city hosts any horror shows/performances - I've been to one in LA a long time ago.

We walk through this narrow way (decorated with scary things - making sounds/veins or roots touching/jump scares) to a central open area. Here, the audience sits down and artists perform.

J’ai récemment remarqué que certaines intersections donne un feu vert au piétons en même temps que le feu clignotant.

Si tu as la clim ou si tu envisages d'en installer une (murale ou centrale), il n'y a aucune raison de ne pas en acheter une. 

Je déconseille de surestimer leur capacité de chauffage, sauf si tu peut acheter un beau système à deux stages ($), et même dans ce cas, tu n'auras plus que 20 % de la capacité (BTU/h) nominale à -20 °C, même si le COP reste respectable. Ceci étant dit, il s'agit de cas particuliers pour nos hivers qui sont de plus en plus doux et tu devras de toute façon avoir un chauffage auxiliaire (électrique ou au gaz) en backup.

________________________________________________________________


Heat pumps are fantastic boosts to home heating efficiency. I generally council people to consider them upon replacement of an end of life furnace since we are moving away from gas and an electric furnace is a nice way to burn money. If you have AC or are adding an AC (mural or central) there is no reason to not get one. 

I do caution against over estimation of their heating capacity unless you can afford a nice two stage system ($) and even then you drop to 20% of the nominal capacity at -20C even if the COP is still respectable. That being said those are edge cases for our winters that are getting more mild and you should have auxiliary heating (electric or gas) as backup anyway. 

I have debated with refrigeration journeymen about increased wear by having higher operating pressures (the refrigerant is pressurized to a much higher degree to seek the thermal energy over a higher temperature difference). To this day I haven't seen much more than anecdotal evidence of increased breakdowns (but i find the concern based in logic).

I work in HVAC so its a topic I'm passionate about. Managed to create a lot of cost savings for public institutions, people really don't think about the means with which we create heat and how easy it is to waste.",Montreal

I see cyclists swerving off bike lanes with no warning, looking or signaling. I see drivers running stops/reds or doing U-turns in the middle of an intersection. The other day I was crossing the street at a pedestrian crossing and some reprobate in a range rover kept going (he was at a fair distance from the intersection when I looked before crossing) right at me and braked at the last second.

"I'll get downvoted for this but people hate the truth. There is no moral or ethical obligation to learn or speak french. There is no law saying you need to know french(or english) either. You will get by in some parts of montreal speaking only english too.

Now that said, 'getting by' is a pretty shit way to live. Not being able to communicate with everyone around you sucks. Not understanding everything written or advertised to you sucks. It will be a constant reminder you are an outsider if you don't learn the basics. I don't mean that in an insulting way. I just mean it like it seems like a waste to not even try. Forget what OTHER people want from you or who wants you to promote X or Y language. Just know its pretty stupid for YOU to only be able to communicate with a fraction of people in your city and go lower and lower the more you leave the island. So I would recommend making the effort to learn the basics. Whether its duolingo, some classes or whatever try something. You don't need to be 100% fluent but if you struggle to have a basic convo you'll be suffering.

Now with all that on the table, it IS generally more respectful to try and acclimate and speak the language(s). I personally don't care if someone speaks to me in english or french though. As long as they are polite it makes zero difference to me.",Montreal

In hindsight and once acquainted with the history behind the birth of Israel an objective mind cannot in good faith be blind to the cruelest and most contemptuous injustice of our time. 
it’s a story of ill intent and total contempt towards the Palestinians by Britain, America and Israel and it is frankly disturbing. This was certain to become a geopolitical super volcano, it was a guaranteed train wreak. (By design? Oil?) Where are those virtuous crusaders for human rights and democracy ? For decades the whole world has been aware of the situation. Petty hypocrisy, nobody lifted a finger or raised an “eyebrow” outside of the Middle East, for fear of reprisals (?)

In North America, if you ever raise that eyebrow upon learning the medieval ways the Israeli Government deals and treats the local Palestinian population and voice your outrage, siding with the WRONGED folks. They laugh at you, many accuse you of “supporting terrorism” or being an anti-semite an anti “democracy” No subject is more slippery and explosive.
