"from what i have seen in my neighbourhood too many people would rather take the chance and risk a parking ticket than pay for parking two green p lots within walking distance of my street one block and two blocks away and everything day there is cars parked on the wrong side it is a one way street or blocking driveways if toronto wants to raise rates they should also consider increasing their parking enforcement efforts from the article > this fall toronto will launch consultations on a citywide parking strategy that could lead to changes in how much real estate the city devotes to stationary vehicles and how much drivers pay for it >the exercise is part of a global trend that has urban centres around the world reconsidering decades old planning orthodoxy that dictates cities need ample and cheap parking in order to thrive proponents of the new philosophy argue that reducing the amount of low cost parking frees up street space for other public uses reduces traffic and helps meet climate targets but any proposal to make parking less readily available and more expensive is sure to provoke pushback from drivers already facing higher costs and business owners struggling to recover from the pandemic >patrick siegman a san francisco based transportation planner said there is a sea change underway in how cities think about parking ""i have never seen anything like it"" in 30 years in the field he said ""parking reform is really snowballing"" >in 2022 roughly one quarter of the parking authority's 250 off street lots had peak weekday occupancy rates of at least 85 per cent the level at which a facility is considered overcapacity and a candidate for higher prices rates at most off street lots range from about $1 to $4 per half hour >jeff dea vice president of business development at the toronto parking authority said the agency's approach is to set prices that are reasonable but high enough to discourage long term stays as frequent turnover allows more people to use the spot and shop at local businesses >the parking authority typically reviews prices annually at off street lots and every three years at on street spots but because of the pandemic on street rates have not been increased since 2017 dea acknowledged rates are now ""a little bit low"" and the agency will recommend ""modest"" on street raises to its board in november but ""we are not looking at dramatic increases"" he said",Toronto

be aware that social media is full of trolls and bots as well as thoughtful comments fill a thread with racist and hateful comments and it undermines valid concerns shared about our housing shortage exacerbated by a massive surge in non permanent residents most comments i see put the blame at the foot of poor governance where it belongs it is only by letting politicians know there is a problem that they even begin to take action we went from a government that was gaslighting canadians saying the solution to the housing shortage was to increase immigration even more and saying housing is not a federal issue then with noise from constituents and a fall in the polls they were having a party retreat focusing on the housing crisis to finally committing tens of billions on housing subsidies and actually floating the idea of a cap on international students now the government cannot actually solve the housing crisis without putting a cap on non permanent residents which is both international students and work permit holders we will never make up the housing deficit because even with billions in subsidies we cannot double the number of housing starts to meet the current level of demand pressure must continue to be put on government until they change course https www150statcangcca n1 daily quotidien 230927 dq230927a enghtm https financialpostcom real estate canada cannot build millions homes 7 years fix affordability,Toronto

the more we create alternative ways for people who do not need to be in cars to get around the more we can reduce traffic so that the ones who really do need cars ie seniors those who need to transport large amounts etc have an easier time of it many people do not bike even if they would like to because there is not the infrastructure many who do bike anyway frequently feel less than safe cars are still allowed on the road they will be fine now people who are biking get some protected space too and then there is public transit yet another option which goes right along the area you mentioned you can avoid the traffic at bloor and old mill by going under it the city has a lot of problems but i strongly disagree with numbering safe cycling infrastructure as one of them,Toronto

i am or ukrainian origin and we have a really interesting law there a land appropriation law it states that if you do not use the agricultural land for 2 years meaning you buy land but it sits empty the government can confiscate it and use it for the benefit of the country this law exists because ukraine is an agricultural land and farmers need land because people need to produce & consume food no compensation is provided if the government seized the land i am not saying we should implement a housing usage law in canada… but it would be nice if the government could take away an unused property and pay the original purchase price for it so that the property is being used to house those who need housing or maybe force the landlord to accept tenants or more like grant the property some sort of a special status that would allow it to house tenants but would be prioritized at the ltb if any claims are filed so there is no wait anyway this is just a fantasy we know this would not happen,Toronto

i really really hope for their sake that the tenants involved do this the proper way save the money they are withholding and do not spend it keep it in a separate account so that if the ltb finds against you you have the money to pay the landlord what the ltb says you owe too many times withholding rent goes sideways for the tenant because they spend the money and cannot pay the arrears leading to eviction and a fucked credit rating and making it pretty much impossible to find another place no other landlords are going to rent to someone with a fresh non payment eviction,Toronto

"long story time just over a year ago i signed a lease on a new place and i got permission from my old landlord to gradually spend about a week moving all my stuff bit by bit so every day i would move another load and do some preliminary organizing in the new place put some books on shelves hang some clothes in the closet etc and then lock up and bring the moving bins back to my old place to refill another load for the next day this is relevant because while i was sleeping in my old place each night all of my stuff more and more of it each day was lying there in the new place which i had yet to learn was absolutely teeming with a bed bug infestation on my final day of moving i locked up the old place for the last time around midnight and brought my last few things over to settle in for my first sleep in my brand new bed at least it was new to me the place came pre furnished from the previous tenant which turned out to be the whole crux of the problem so i got into bed and turned out the light to go to sleep with my phone charging on the pillow beside me just as i was closing my eyes the phone just happened to light up with a notification and as i looked over i caught what looked like a little dot scurrying across the screen thinking it might be a spider or something i quickly sat up and turned the light on just in time to see literally dozen upon dozens of tiny dots scattered across the headboard and my pillows swarming is the only word to describe it i knew immediately what they were and i leapt out of the bed in abject horror i tore off my pajamas and put on the first fresh clothes i could grab from the most recent bag i had brought over grabbed only my wallet phone and my keys and booked it from the house i walked several blocks in shock before finally flagging down a taxi i do not really know what else i could have done but i forever hope that none of the little buggers hitched a ride into that cab with me i fled straight to my partner's place and as soon as i got in the door stripped fully naked again putting all the clothes i had been wearing directly into a double sealed garage bag and then showered for what seemed like hours the next day i managed to break my lease thank goodness and the landlord who swore he had no idea let me move all my belongings into his garage for the day to sort through them while he brought fumigators into the apartment to try to salvage the place before looking for a new tenant i spent 18 hours on the concrete floor of the garage sorting everything i own into ""laundry quarantine trash"" categories by the end of that night i had officially moved in with my partner i stored everything i moved outside on his balcony in double sealed bins wrapped in garbage bags until they could be fully treated the funny thing about all this was that we had fully intended to move in together anyway but when i had had to suddenly move out of my original place w",Toronto

the uk does not have the space luxury that the us has so here we have to reuse space add to the equation that some buildings over here are so old that they are protected for historical significance so you will find churches that have been deconsecrated that are well situated so that land cannot be left abandoned and the building cannot be destroyed so they get converted into flats homes bars and restaurants how it is to live in depends entirely on the quality of the refurbishment old churches have thick walls so they can be very sturdy builds but of course it depends entirely on the builder and the budget these buildings can still be owned by the church which may account for the reasonable rent however the churches have been known to be sold to private individuals as well,London

homeowners are i believe still in the majority nationally neither wants to upset their voting bloc via policies that would threaten that bloc's property values foreign investment is adding a lot of fuel to that fire but consider the issues we have with addressing that first matter within our national economics and then consider what options we have to take an effective stance toward global funding an equivalent is the corporation tax problem too low and your nation is home to a flurry of resource consuming revenue collecting market cornering companies that do not pay their way to operate too high and the concern is that they will just incorporate elsewhere and we will fall behind i suppose the long and short of it is that our century long obsession with homeownership has built a bubble that no one wants to risk popping,London

a lack of commitment is due to choice paralysis i am going to this comes from knowing that you have plenty of other potential matches waiting for you at your finger tips in a women i usually try and look for someone who enjoys doing the same things as me but is able to appreciate and enjoy things outside of their comfort zone something i get to see with time honestly if i see someone is profile and it looks like their personality revolves around drinking despite myself loving a night out i know we are probably not compatible cos i am not a big drinker at all it is funny because on dating apps a lot of women do not really put any effort into showing who they actually are which i understand because for the most part men are visual creatures so why make the effort you may ask some of us actually care and are motivated to find connection beyond purely physical attraction as it is something i have already done and realised it is not what longevity is built on despite living in slondon i rarely get suggested black women's profiles especially on hinge it is not like i do not find black women attractive so i do not know why my algorithm is behaving that way it definitely exists because they ask about race and it builds an idea of your compatibility but yeah 30 white m looking for a long term pic,London

i hate noisy neighbours but by noisy neighbours i specifically mean the family on the other side of my wall who regularly get drunk and blast music through multiple speakers inside and outside until 4am on weekdays… so i would personally love to swap places with your neighbour any day no real advice i am afraid could be a sound proofing issue though sometimes the noise coming through walls floorboards projects louder for the person on the receiving end than it does for the unsuspecting noise creator so that could be the case or she might just have a stick up her a$$ i used to live in an area with a lot of kids and families and there was an unspoken rule that noise levels needed to be reduced after 11pm unless it is a birthday event and you have let everyone know in advance and before 9am on weekends but 7pm on a saturday is a bit much… good luck my friend,London

1 it is exhausting to be constantly putting oneself out there and being genuine about wanting to make a connection only to find out the other person is looking for attention or wants to play games there is definitely a factor of just hitting the numbers with dating until you find something that clicks but i feel like people are not willing to be as genuine anymore and so nothing ever really feels like it goes anywhere 2 easier to have options on hand if people do not get invested or are not genuine if things do not work with one there is always another 3 someone who puts in the effort to themselves and whomever else they are seeing if i am showing up i am saying you are worth my time to get to know you better and try and start something reciprocity of that would be nice being hot does not override having no personality 4 yes but to your second one no i think some cultures are more similar than others and the cultural experience or gap with black women for me is just a bit too wide to bridge,London

ah yes man who is so incredibly bland and boring he lists nice as a quality does not succeed in romance this could be because women see his paragraphs whinging about his ex girlfriend and decide that actually a glass of wine and a vera on tv sound like a better option or it could be because women are bitches who do not know a nice guy when they see one even if this guy is not particularly nice when you reject his romantic advances,London

my take and it is just my opinion east has plenty of gangs south too lots of young people with no real opportunity or chance to improve their lives they turn to a culture where it is possible to make quick cash with drugs and violence the problem is this current sink or swim mentality we all have the same chances does not work for marginalised communities they need additional help and support but the white population are not willing to accept and provide additional support to help support people in poverty so the cycle continues there is also a problem of absent fathers which typically leads to an impoverished upbringing without that family father support again the cycle of poverty continues there is a really easy fix but this country would rather spend billions on a train line they cannot deliver than support marginalised communities in poverty to help people i know people do not want handouts i am not suggesting that simply better support education opportunities free uni proper childcare etc,London

"here is the thing mobile phones contain a lot of valuable materials in them even if you just considered gold of which your phone contains about £180 worth if you were to process a tonne of phones you would get 300 times more gold than processing s tonne of gold ore because the gold in the phone is already purified if opportunistic thieves are willing to nick a £5 steak to flog for a few quid they are also going to be willing to nick a phone even if it is just for the literal value of the metals as things stand though the phones are either used overseas where the police and networks do not care and manufacturers cannot stop them or they are broken down for parts and sold to ""repair shops"" or literally chop shopped like a car and then sold maybe theoretically if you make the phone totally useless apart from the value of the metals if it was stolen it will discourage gangs from stealing phones en mass i am not convinced that is possible though and if it was it could double the price of your phone",London

it is also common now for the 125% to be added to a table of any size where it used to be for 6 people or more also for some places to ask if you would like to leave a tip when paying knowing that there is already 125% added so customers end up paying over the odds when tipping i have asked for service to be removed where it has been really bad and only once did it because any problem the waiter got the manager involved and their argument was that the service was always like that slow service cold food one main arriving twenty minutes after the others and nobody else complains so why were we so special,London

more houses built or less money in the market is what needs to happen we could reduce demand by taxing investment houses second houses etc more than primary residence as an example if your house is a 'second home' then you can pay a multiple of the normal council tax,London
agree with most of the sensible suggestions in this thread the reality is that crashing the housing market and reducing house prices by 50% overnight will because more economic problems than it would solve housing issues therefore any approach should be focused around three things 1 bringing stability to housing prices if people know that a 350k house will still be worth 350k in two years time that helps when it comes to savings and planning this has to come through increasing the supply either through more house building or making it less attractive to own empty properties 2 restrict predatory activities by landlords limit rental increases to inflation stricter policies around repairs etc no no fault evictions 3 make non housing purchase costs cheaper for young buyers eg i would suggest making stamp duty payable at the point of sale rather than purchase that guarantees zero stamp duty for first time buyers and means those who benefit most from house price inflation pay their fair share introduce a rental properties purchaae tax to keep higher costs on buying property to rent out maybe also set up a subsidised conveyancing service for ftb as well to help with those costs,London

like many things a heavy separation from companies to what should be the people's resource i do not know know a lot about how housing works but restrictions on how many homes a single person can own and buy all houses must be brought under a name not a company company owned living facilities like hotels must be built converted from non housing structures a cap on house value and rent per square meter while also gutting out any middle men who inflate house building costs though laws change the way houses are valued everyone needs a place to live regardless of its location it should be valued for what it is and its condition not locations views etc unoccupied homes will be taxed for future government build projects landlords can choose to reliquish their property if they are unable to sell it this is where future build projects can take over to renovate and sell rent to further add to their own funding the cost of rent will be based on maintenance of the property only paying to occupy a property is worthless since it would be taxed otherwise exploits in the housing market will be monitored by an independant body so house costs remain low to protect the people repeated offenders will lose the property ies involved and be taken over by future build projects existing company brought homes must be sold or face fines after any existing tenancy agreement has ended i get that there maybe some rough edges to iron out on this and some details to fill in but having any solution is better than just complain about the problem,London

it is been mega weird i have always likened it to spareroom everyone has a tick list you can see them checking off their preferences then blanking when they realise you do not have the things they are looking for the pinnacle for me was two dates with someone who was lovely but a little distant she would mentioned losing a grandparent so i put it down to that as she seemed as though it had hit hard after the second date we talked on the way to the station and she told me she was in the middle of a divorce and had only just started dating again i understood as i have seen friends & family going through the same thing although i have not been through it myself it must be a strange time we parted ways but i said i would drop her a message in a month or two maybe go to a restaurant we would talked about which she seemed happy with when that time passed i went into the archive in whatsapp to find her and her profile pic was back to her wedding photo,London
"one thing to note in the uk since you are new everybody always says ""see you later"" as a means of saying goodbye they do not actually mean literally see you later so if he said that to you that is normal being very insistent on you providing personal info when he just randomly met you is not normal that is suspicious i have had random experiences like this as well just do not engage too much or give vague responses most people in london are harmless no matter how strange they appear",London

they have inflated prices at a time of economic downturn when i moved into this area in london around 2005 2 curries 2 rice or nan was sub £10 you would throw in a bhaji or other side so you could give the delivery person £15 and they have a £3 2 keep the change tip then the 2010 recession happened and quality went down drastically to keep a price point then prices rose year over year as quality of food went down then came along these delivery businesses my sub £10 2x curry is now £30 25% loyalty bonus 50p card processing and the delivery person are not getting a cash tip i actually justeat mc donnalds as there is a 30 mins wait for saver menu cheese burger n fries which are just sat there in front of you in restraint or i can just watch telly @ home quality down prices up next question needs to be the pimping enslavement of delivery riders drivers doing the actual deliveries over the person who owns the account,London

seems to be that the building is covered in scaffolding and associated hoarding so it is not like the residents would be getting much use out of the windows while the presumed repair works are taking place but reading the article it does also seem there is an issue with some people leaving these hoardings and scaffolding up for way too long so possibly there is a dodgy deal going on where some are exploiting a loophole to essentially get massive billboards put up where planning would have otherwise stopped them,London
if it is a regular thing rather than a one off then get a dog walker that is what we do ours is the most chilled dog and has been fine being left longer for 4 hours due to an extended wait at a&e but we would never do that as a planned regular thing which is what it sounds like you would be doing i could not imagine having a dog and not planning our lives to ensure his needs are met he is part of our family and leaving him home alone for that length of time regularly is uncaring,London

happened to my flat before if you have an economy 7 meter and the previous tenant incorrectly reported the night rate as day rate and vice vers you could be screwed you do not really notice it during summer until temperature drops below 20'c the reason is your boiler would automatically use night energy to heat up the entire tank more units consumed and only use day energy to somewhat maintain the temperature less units consumed normally it takes up 3x more electricity at night with this type of on off peak arrangement so if you are paying day time tariff for the electricity consumed at night you could easily get a bill over £230,London

there is a crazy thing lately where people want to show they do not care as they think it is cool when realistically it is not to most with sense or they literally just want fwb so it do not matter to them a woman has to be a package in your 20s it is superseded by someone hot but as you get late 20s early 30s then connection and how you better each others as a person matters more interracial to me is more than fine as i find women with a darker skin tone more attractive and i am a white guy but some people do like women of their own herritage exclusively it happens and it is what it is but as you get older then connection means more to most north east guy who works in london often lived in london previously,London

"yeah we do this weird thing where when we use ""you alright"" ""you okay"" etc as a greeting we tend intonate it with a higher pitch at the end as if we are actually asking the question which we are not we just want to hear ""yeah not bad you"" and when we are genuinely asking the question as a concern at least in my experience it tends to intonate down at the end but yeah the trick is to answer the question without really answering it eg ""good"" ""not bad"" ""alright"" ""you know how it is"" etc and then just immediately asking them the question back i think most brits in general would hear a ""how are ya"" ""how is it going"" etc as a greeting and interpret it exactly the same as how we just say ""you alright"" provided it is the first thing that comes out of your mouth but i can only really speak to myself",London
it is a weird one because i also live in an older building and i never hear the upstairs couples very young infant cry i mean ever i did not know they would had the baby until it was 10 weeks old in fact i have never been really disturbed by noises from their flat some days them going up and down their stairs will be oddly louder than others also i am talking complete silence vs it sounding like they have an elephant up there it is very bizarre and inconsistent and they are definitely not doing anything out of the ordinary the last three nights or so every night i am woken up by their floor boards creaking at 3am i assume they are up doing night feeds they creak directly above my bedroom it is been the weirdest thing what i am trying to say is it could be something completely normal suddenly making a more significant noise than normal and you do not even realise it unlike your neighbor i kind of just shrug it off because old building and i cannot imagine what i could ask them to change beyond ceasing all human activity which seems unreasonable,London

i agree that the uk is bad but let us not exaggerate rome is much worse there is rubbish everywhere in some places and it is not just bottles there is clothes and all sorts of things sometimes even chairs or other large items it is a mess ultimately the problem is do with our culture people simply do not care they think it is acceptable it is not something we will able to change anytime soon unless we put much more effort into enforcing it i would start by introducing extremely high fines for littering we also need to make sure that more people get fined aside from that we need to educate people more,London

j'ai travaillé à la défense pendant longtemps et j'avoue que je n'apprécie pas cet endroit c'est extrêmement bétonné malgré les récentes tentatives de mettre du vert le quartier est construit au dessus du sol donc il est compliqué de mettre de la verdure avoir de l'eau ou faire pousser de grands arbres je trouve que contrairement à certains quartiers de paris la défense n'a aucune âme et aucune culture c'est vraiment juste un quartier d'affaire bondé en semaine et vide le weekend sur le parvis il y a simplement un centre commercial et des bureaux aucune vie de quartier je n'ai aucune sensibilité pour l'architecture avec de grandes tours en béton et des immeubles en verre c'est sûrement photogénique pour certaines personnes mais ça ne me touche pas bref c'est pas mon truc,Paris

most women do not go on dating apps to seriously date they go on dating apps to get attention and temporalily boost their ego when they are bored it is not all of them but they do that quite more often than men some will not respond after a match the value was the dopamine from the match not actually talking to you some can talk to you for a while but when you try to get a date they ghost you to not be disappointed expect this as the default behavior you need to try a lot if you actually want an actual date way more than in real life that is how it is,Paris

some quick math 2000000 people in paris 500000 25% between 20 35 100000 conservative estimate that 1 in 5 are single 50000 men 50000 women 35000 70% are men on dating apps 20000 40% women are on dating apps so is this to say you have 1 35k odds of just even appearing in the card stack for the entire city of paris and i that population estimate is lower than official one and probably excludes people passing throughthere are also paid users who appear first apparently then there is the matter of there being far more men chasing fewer women so naturally they have many options at least with hinge it is more direct than the likes of tinder where you can see who likes you but you will still be in a large queue especially for good looking women who will be flooded with likes and messages so to get from being seen liked match message date relationship takes a lot is this type of rough estimation on the right tracks or what am i missing here,Paris

sweet summer child edit all jokes aside the ticket plateform has been opened in april 2023 i think and was available for access via invitation only you had to register for it earlier in 2022 when if you were picked you had to chose packages of three sports which were completely un related if you wanted to complete your purchase however affordable tickets ran out in the blink of an eye and pricepoints were stupidely high really fast like 2000€ fast for a qualifier round of whatever obscure sport high let alone athletism or swimming cool disciplines in cool places like fencing in grand palais or track running in stade de france was basically out of reach in july we have reached the phase where you can buy individual sports but that does not change the fact that tickets are not available the organization said there would be a resell platform with caped price to avoid scalping but this olympics marketed like a people's event is already a shitshow for not being accessible you know by the people here is the official e shophttps ticketsparis2024org nonetheless,Paris

"frenchman here currently living in paris great initiative the following advice comes from 12 years of traveling the world living studying and working in multiple countries meeting americans in the us and elsewhere tourists and expatriates alike in a very diverse set of situations as well as discussing their behavior online and with my friends from my own understanding of the usual stereotypes associated with american tourists it is more of a behavioral issue than anything the main ones are 1 being obnoxious speaking loudly attention seeking behaviors discretion and a ""less is more"" philosophy are considered to be ""polite"" ""elegant"" and ""chic"" behaviors that is even more the case in places of cultural and historical relevance but that also works for hotels and restaurants the subway bus or any public place 2 acting untitled like you own the place lacking self awareness about your behavior not trying to adapt or understand other countries' cultures ""when in rome do as the romans do"" the latter usually comes from a lack of understanding and education about the culture in question understanding a country's culture takes years of both living in the country and speaking its language fluently you cannot google that or watch a youtube tutorial it is a great start and means your mindset is in the right place but it is not enough especially when talking about cultures that have thousands of years of history and traditions you do not learn that in days weeks or even months so my best advice is to remain ""lowkey"" to be respectful and curious and to stay humble in the face of your own ignorance it is normal to not fully comprehend another culture just do not act like you do that is what i have always applied for myself in any country i have visited or lived in and it always worked wonders 3 expecting everybody to speak english and not making any effort to speak a few words of french when your students speak english they should do so slowly and articulately most french people over the age of 40 and even under would struggle to understand an american person speaking at a ""normal"" pace for a native speaker if they can even understand you at all it is improving in big french cities but it is better not to expect it and then be pleasantly surprised when your waiter happens to speak fluently rather than to expect everybody to adapt to you and be disappointed do not make it sound like you are speaking to a child either body language is universal when it comes to that sort of thing also ""customer is king"" is a very misunderstood belief that i see a lot i have studied marketing for the record it should rather be ""a good customer is king"" france has been the most visited country in the world for about the past 30 consecutive years the french restaurants do not need ""shitty customers"" from other countries they already have plenty being a kind and respectful customer inste",Paris

i actually had a positive experience and got placed in a fulltime class within a month it is definitely necessary to be proactive though and take initiative to reach out aside from fulltime classes there is a variety of part time classes as well for which each has a separate intake course schedule frequency registration period so reaching out to those significantly increases your chances some websites are dated or unclear just call if you cannot find something in the end it was absolutely worth it for me good luck,Montreal

apologies to ask this question on your post with halloween around the corner and in a new city thought i would give it a try curious to know if the city hosts any horror shows performances i have been to one in la a long time ago it was something like this we entered a dark room with pin hole torches we walk through this narrow way decorated with scary things making sounds veins or roots touching jump scares to a central open area here the audience sits down and artists perform after the show we walk back through a different way with similar jump scares the thing that i loved the most was how immersive it was would be nice to visit if such a place exists before my trip ends this week merci,Montreal

un des plus gros problèmes de sécurité dans cette ville est la constance de la signalisation certaine pistes cyclables do not tous les tronçons du rev bénéficient de virages protégés l'ensemble des usagers automobilistes et cyclistes sont habitué à rouler d'une certaine manière avec feu protégé le changement soudain de cette protection entraîne donc une plus grande chance d'incident c'est la même chose avec le feu clignotant vert qui signale habituellement la priorité pour un virage j'ai récemment remarqué que certaines intersections donne un feu vert au piétons en même temps que le feu clignotant je suis entièrement conscient que les piétons ont priorités dans ce cas mais il serait difficile d'en vouloir à un automobiliste de croire qu'il a la priorité puisque dans 98% des cas les feux clignotants ne sont pas accompagnés par un feu piéton vert je ne dit pas que ceci excuse les automobilistes mais que le manque de constance dans la signalisation peut faire en sorte que les usagers maintiennent des comportements qui ne sont pas sécuritaires dans ces instances,Montreal

i used to rent a room in one of these pretty old houses with a colorful roof tourists would constantly be taking pictures to be honest it does get annoying when you have to be vigilant to pull the curtains every time you change and when you cannot hang out in the living room in peace because you are aware that someone might be looking inside at any time it is not even that much that you would actually be seen in the photo but it does give you a feeling that you are constantly being observed people just like their peace you know it was annoying when i would just look out of my bedroom window after waking up and i would see a group of tourists taking pictures and then i would have to step back to not be in the pictures hiding in my own home that being said that guy was being an asshole and there is definitely no law defending you from taking pictures of buildings,Montreal

les thermopompes sont des outils formidables pour améliorer l'efficacité du chauffage je conseille généralement aux gens de les envisager lors du remplacement d'un appareil de chauffage en fin de vie car nous nous éloignons du gaz et un appareil de chauffage électrique est un bon moyen de brûler de l'argent si tu as la clim ou si tu envisages d'en installer une murale ou centrale il n'y a aucune raison de ne pas en acheter une je déconseille de surestimer leur capacité de chauffage sauf si tu peut acheter un beau système à deux stages $ et même dans ce cas tu n'auras plus que 20 % de la capacité btu h nominale à 20 c même si le cop reste respectable ceci étant dit il s'agit de cas particuliers pour nos hivers qui sont de plus en plus doux et tu devras de toute façon avoir un chauffage auxiliaire électrique ou au gaz en backup j'ai débattu avec des frigoristes de l'usure accrue due à des pressions de fonctionnement plus élevées le réfrigérant est pressurisé à un degré beaucoup plus élevé pour rechercher l'énergie thermique sur une differentérence de température plus importante à ce jour je n'ai pas vu beaucoup plus que des preuves anecdotiques de l'augmentation des pannes mais le craint est logique je travaille dans le domaine du cvac c'est donc un sujet qui me passionne les gens ne pensent pas vraiment aux moyens par lesquels nous créons de la chaleur et à la facilité avec laquelle nous la gaspillons j'ai réussi à réaliser de nombreuses économies pour les institutions publiques heat pumps are fantastic boosts to home heating efficiency i generally council people to consider them upon replacement of an end of life furnace since we are moving away from gas and an electric furnace is a nice way to burn money if you have ac or are adding an ac mural or central there is no reason to not get one i do caution against over estimation of their heating capacity unless you can afford a nice two stage system $ and even then you drop to 20% of the nominal capacity at 20c even if the cop is still respectable that being said those are edge cases for our winters that are getting more mild and you should have auxiliary heating electric or gas as backup anyway i have debated with refrigeration journeymen about increased wear by having higher operating pressures the refrigerant is pressurized to a much higher degree to seek the thermal energy over a higher temperature difference to this day i have not seen much more than anecdotal evidence of increased breakdowns but i find the concern based in logic i work in hvac so its a topic i am passionate about managed to create a lot of cost savings for public institutions people really do not think about the means with which we create heat and how easy it is to waste,Montreal

quebec born here applied in june the day after they announced their reformed website service still have not heard back i did pay for french classes over the summer since i had a feeling this would happen l was in the francizisation class in 2021 2022 winter and was aware that its unlikely they have classes during the summer part time because of a lack of students teachers so i jumped the gun and took a paid french as a second language 300$ level at dawson which i highly recommend if your looking for part time they teach the same curriculum but faster paced so its 2 3 months part time per level rather than the whole fall and winter semester for 1 level with the francisization program which essentially would take 1 year per level,Montreal
