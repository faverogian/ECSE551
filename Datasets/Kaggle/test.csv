0,"How is this even enforceable? Is it just people who have their Uber addresses in Toronto? What about all of the people who live in Pickering, Markham, Brampton etc? How are they going to stop them from coming into the city and working? 

Or is it going to be location-based? Does that mean if someone has a ride from the airport into Toronto they aren't going to be able to get any rides until they leave the city?"
1,"Undoubtedly putting more commuters on electric transit rather than on petro consuming private vehicles would be a plus. Similarly, turning more space from roadways to walkways would make the core a greener and more welcoming space. 

Public transit use declined over the pandemic and has stayed down since. That's meant a noticeable increase in congestion on the roads. Drivers are fully aware, but keep driving. It's worth considering why. 

Anecdotally, pre-pandemic my wife preferred transit. They've discontinued the route she took from near our home to the heart of the city, so the trip now involves more transfers and more time. She finds that subway's are flooded during rush hour, often meaning a 15 minute delay until she can get on a train. When she does get on, she often feels unsafe. 

Generally, our transit system is inadequate, poorly maintained, and many believe it's unsafe. Until that's changed, we can try to force people back to transit, but those who can afford to dive will continue to do so. Expert input suggests we'll need sustained annual investment over 10+ years to begin improving Toronto's transit situation. Keeping investment going, year after year, is important to create and maintain the expertise and the resources needed for successful implementation of new lines. Cities such as Madrid have shown the way."
2,"Shoppers used to have decent sales BEFORE Loblaws took it over. I remember every 2 weeks milk would go on sale for $3.99 /4L. They would have sales, now nothing is a great deal. Before the pandemic gravel for 100 count their brand  was $5.05 now it is over $15. How is that justifiable? As for it being a convenient store, they have tons of stores and have one of the largest grocery store chains and affiliates in Canada.... I  am all for supporting Canadian stores and businesses, but when the American stores are a third cheaper. Nope, I will go for the most reasonable.  I live in downtown and will TTC it to Scarborough for the deals. Loblaws owns the Real Canadian Super Stores, No Frills and  Shoppers Drugmart and on every corner. Not to mention they had the Weston Bakery...which they closed that was at Logan and Queen. So who has the big box stores??? Ya the the Weston family is raking in the cash. Believe or don't there are more of those stores vs Walmart. It is sad a Canadian found company ripping off Canadians duringtimes tht eople need to choose to pay for bills and housing themselves working families. So people will go where it is cheaper to shop..  They will continue to raise prices because they aren't competitive anymore. Loyalty be dammed....Sad but true they have lost a customer ??"
3,"Yeah no, all this anti-immigration talk will lead to something like Trump or Brexit.  You don't get nuance when having a conversation with the general public or even reddit.

The plan is also supported by a design team comprised of subject matter experts and industry leaders, including Two Row Architect, a 100 per cent Indigenous-owned and operated firm from the Six Nations reserve.

> There is a dearth of public space in the downtown core, and as the waterfront develops more activity has moved away, said Karen Chapple, director of the School of Cities at the University of Toronto, who is researching downtown recoveries around the world. A solution that has helped Times Square is pedestrianizing the surrounding area, she said.
> 
> The city doesn’t plan to go that far. It is moving into the consulting phase in its plan to reduce that stretch of Yonge Street to two lanes and expand sidewalks and bike lanes, as well as “activity” sections for cafe-style seating. Construction is not expected to start for two years.
> 
> Chapple would like to see the area pivot away from big-box store “street-killers” to small business store fronts that are pedestrian-friendly. But more than that, she suggests the vision for the square be focused on making it a gathering place and then seeing what fits around it.
> 
> Vernadette Saguil and Ernesto Salas live in the area. Often they can’t find seating in the square, but on this day they’ve found a cool spot under a tree with their dogs, Julius and Marcus.
> 
> Saguil wishes there was a more “European-style” vibe to the space with more to see and do, especially given the number of people that live in the area. (The square was actually billed to the city and public as a “European-style” square at the time of its launch.)
> 
> Salas suggests more greenery, and even a green roof above the shelter that runs along the north side of the square.

Consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal Canada Inc. has been appointed as the receiver of all assets.

“The One Project has faced various economic headwinds, including impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and unanticipated work stoppages, which together with other factors have resulted in material cost overages and extended construction timelines,” Alvarez & Marsal said in a statement on its website.

OP is reminiscing about a 50kph speed limit, so let's say you drive an optimistic 60kph and it'll take 22mins which is a difference of 7mins.  Keep in mind that's staying at those speeds the entire time with nothing to slow you down like construction, traffic, traffic lights, weather etc. Which means in reality the time saved by not keeping  the higher speed limit is much less. 

Just for reference Google maps is estimating 82mins on a pleasant Sunday afternoon, 50 minutes without traffic.

Our contractor also did their due diligence and found the same. No tie backs.

In this instance, with so many buildings in the area, it should be an automatic assumption that they'll find tie backs in their path. The fault will lie with whoever is identified in the contract as requiring to perform their due diligence."

More than 100 tenants at two northwest Toronto apartment buildings will go on rent strike Sunday, joining the ranks of nearly 500 residents who have been withholding payments since early summer.
  

  
The tenants, residing at 1440 and 1442 Lawrence Avenue West, claim their landlord, Barney River Investments, has refused to address serious repairs in the building while attempting to implement above-guideline rent increases.

According to Padovani, the deteriorating conditions at the northwest Toronto residences, including a serious insect infestation, have gotten to the point that Canada Post has ceased mail delivery to the residences citing unsafe working conditions.
  

  
Padovani says the buildings' elevators are often out of service – an accessibility concern for residents – and that the garbage chutes have not been properly maintained.
  

  
“If you walk down the halls you can always smell a foul smell,” she said.

The Lawrence Avenue residents will join the ranks of hundreds of tenants from 33 King Street, 22 John Street, and 71, 75, and 79 Thorncliffe Park Drive in Toronto who have been withholding rent payments – many since June – decrying above-guideline increases and a state of disrepair in their homes."
41,"I grew up in London, ON. It’s not a terrible place to raise a family. 

Moved out over a decade ago and would never move back, simply because I cannot drive and there’s no decent way to live in London if you have to rely on public transit or cycling. Even if you can drive, expect to drive a lot because the city is designed poorly even for drivers. 

That aside, I’m a little shocked at people calling London the worst city in Canada. I’d much, much, much rather live in London than Mississauga. London is still an old city with a downtown core and the bones to make it something special. There are so many impossibly boring parking lot surburban cities that truly have nothing going on compared to London. That’s not hometown pride. Canada has some dead zones and dead cities. Wouldn’t call London one of them."
42,"And these are just the N12 applications that have been *officially filed* and are on record. How many more situations are there where the landlord suddenly says he has a (fictional) son that needs to move into the unit, which triggers the tenant to start looking for a new place to live? In my case I called his bluff and said I would keep an eye out for the official paperwork and didn't hear another word about it again.

71,"What do you think the reason for this is? My own opinion is that the mix of different cultures and habits, and the lack of feeling of belonging to the local culture and community enable this kind of behaviour. 

If you feel like you belong to the local community then the social control is more effective."
72,"This type of low level anti semitism? Stupid comments, vandalism etc ? Absolutely, it’s easily done and low cost.

Actual violence , physical intimidation of people etc ? Unfortunately yes :( just nowhere near as much. Sad that Jewish school kids being told to not wear uniform to avoid being a target."
73,"Might be that the latitude / longatude has not been read correctly and y defaults one of te positions to zero which translates to that position.

74,"1. Build council houses 
2. make it illegal for someone to own more than one home. No one needs two homes. You can live with your partner in your home and they have a home in their name which you rent out that's fine. But
3. no less than 3 months for rental contracts, gutting air bnb nonsense.
4. Companies can't own homes. People own homes.
5. You cannot buy a house if you're not permanently living in the UK. No more investors buying properties just to let it sit and the value go up."
75,"As the property is old and probably converted i to flats a long time ago there's probably no sound insulation between the two flats which can be a nightmare. You can't rwally do anything about it. 

Try to find out when is was converted and do some research on when regulations regarding nose insulation came in. It could be the landlord has done a shoddy job of converting the house and if you can prove it, he might be forced to retro install.

If you're 100% sure you're not making too much noise (you might not realise you are), you could call your neighbour's bluff and see if the council will come round and check. This *could* backfire."
76,"The Ginger Pig in Borough Market also does pasties (I assume they sell them at the other stores too?). And when it's a beautifully cold winters day, there's nothing like one of their steak pasties to both fill and warm you up.

Iirc, they use all the good meat that they haven't sold and need to use before it goes bad, and so the meat content is always top notch too. 

As for your sausage rolls and scotch eggs, they are also some of the best in London. So it's no fluke."
77,"I have my own favourite bench in Regents park .

It's in a quiet spot but I'm still able to watch the park and people from there.

Whenever I went there it was empty so I considered it mine.

Edit : I just went on Google maps and I can see people sitting on my bench. Glad to see it's not just me who enjoys that corner."
78,"I'd buy a house around the corner. I don't know if I suffer from a lack of imagination, or am just so happy here being a multimillionaire wouldn't make any difference. Anyway, one of the Victorian houses backing onto South Park in Parsons Green. Settrington Road. I love it here, and I love that park."
79,"Columbia Rd is a must on any given Sunday. They are having a Day of the Dead parade & festival on the last Saturday of October.

80,"Massive social house building investment will make a big difference for both renters (social and private) and buyers.

Demand for homes far, far outstrips supply and has done for quite some time. So we can reduce demand, or increase supply."

82,"Does she own the building? I think your downstairs neighbour seems very angry.  You mention you don't want to move,but if me,I think I would commence a passive search  for a new place.  Its just going to escalate and you have to be able to live your life without tension of an unreasonable neighbour"
83,"1. Get rid of short term rentals (airBnB)
2. No foreign investor ownership - if you don’t even live in the UK you don’t get to buy houses here that British residents could live in. Residence based, not nationality - a Brit abroad can’t buy here, a Frenchman living here can. Sod taxing it more, just ban it
3. Build a fuckton more homes"
84,"Based on the shops you've named (Zara, M&S) I'm going to take a guess on what your price range is and the sort of clothes you want. Since you call yourself a professional I'm going to assume you can afford a smidge higher. It would help in future if you could give an idea on how much you think is reasonable to spend and what your ""look"" is.

Massimo Dutti, Levi's, Next, Carhartt, Charles Tyrwhitt, Percival, Colorful Standard, and Arket are all worth a nose."
85,"Once I took a picture of someone in the tube just because he looked alike a friend of mine. The guy realised, he was really pissed off. Once he had to get off the tube, he approached me saying ‘next time you can ask’ .. me: ‘what?’ He: ‘the photograph’ . Sbam, I felt really embarrassed"
86,"Why not just simply curb non residential ownership to one additional buy to let property aside from primary residence? Given the mortgage market here is actually quite flexible vs US (as low as 5% down) the issue here seems to be how absurd the focus is on owning rental properties as an additional income stream. Put it in stocks and bonds, help fund the government. Am I missing something very basic here? I’m foreign so maybe I don’t get it"
87,"It must be a very recent change because I remember seeing it called Black Boy Lane when I was looking at flats throughout 2021/2022, so it might not be a protest against the renaming as much as it is people aren't going to go out of their way to update things when they don't feel a need for the change."
88,"Maybe precisely because you're average and think of yourself as such.

When dating, people don't want average. They want something that enthuses them. Otherwise, why bother?

My advice is to get some individuality rather than simply copying what you think everyone else is doing."
89,"Setting up a shop in Soho is quite an expensive affair. I would suggest that you look for pop-up places there and try your products out. If you are successful then look for a more permanent place.

If you have identified a shop you are interested in then ask neighbouring shops about shopfitters as there are cowboys around who will take you for an expensive ride.

I don't think 5k will get you much space in places like Soho.

Good luck whatever you decide."

91,The Vault under Milroy's of Soho is perfect but you need a reservation cause it's tiny and always full. Another one is Disrepute which is more of a cocktail bar but still pretty hidden and closes quite late too. Shift in Soho is fantastic as well but definitely not quiet.
92,"Crossbones Graveyard (Union St, London SE1 1TA) tiny site where thousands of people who had ""fallen out of favour with the church"" were buried many children born out of wedlock, sex workers, unmarried pregnant women etc. Some very sad stories"
93,"I don't get who goes to Pret. It's a slightly posher sandwich meal with shite crisps/snack/drink options for double the price. It's not like I don't have the disposable income to waste on Pret, I can just think of better ways to waste it. Fuck Pret man."
94,"The sad thing is whoever bought those rings probably paid a load more than she got for them. The resale value isn't great and you're giving up a load of sentimental value.

Plus, this isn't a sustainable way of getting more cash. Once you've sold all the jewellery, there's nothing left to pawn next time."
95,"Used to be a common occurrence back in the days before uber and night tubes. Walk out of a late bar or club, guys everywhere shouting 'taxi'.. you couldn't move quick enough to get in that 'strangers' car before someone else nicked it. It's how mini cabs worked.

Now it seems everyone is wierded out by getting in a strangers car at 5am to get a lift home and worried about being axed to death and chopped up. So top effort sir!

And yes, they all knew a place to go after! How good or risky these places were, I don't know...."
96,"I’ve lived in London for 11 years and this has absolutely not changed whatsoever in the time I’ve been here. Some behaviour on public transport is shocking, but the idea it’s actually got noticeably worse is laughable."
97,"I’ve been dating on and off the past 5 years and it’s definitely worse. I don’t think most guys in London are looking for anything serious. They’ve changed up the algorithms in the apps and it’s rare I’ll see people I have much in common with on there. Had my fair share of ghosting and emotionally unavailable sorts. It’s properly exhausting so I empathise! 

That’s great you’re content being single. I feel the same. I’m very close to deleting the apps"
98,"Deliveroo was great initially - all the quality restaurants that didn't do takeaway were in there. Suddenly also cheap restaurants were added in. Then random delivery only places. Then just random crap. Then you compare the prices and the burrito place for 7 quid is charging 11 on deliveroo on top of you paying deliveroo for the pleasure. And their business model e courages poor driver behaviour.                

We're trying to reduce delivery and collect from local high street if we don't want to cook. It's difficult to break the habit but totally worth it."
99,"Typical racist, unprofessional police. Fucking ridiculous armed police were even needed for a 13 year old. Can armed police not assess a situation? Or are they flying off adrenaline as soon as the call comes in? Honestly we need a complete overhaul of the Met in London. I am a white male and there is no way this happens to a 13 year old white boy in London."
100,"I’d say it’s not the worst it’s ever been (born in London and old by Reddit standards), but it has got worse over the last 10-15years.

Agree dog fouling is worse now as well.

I have said this in another comment but I think schoolkids should have to litter pick and do some hours of community service. Not optional, a requirement. Doesn’t matter if you go to a private school or the worst school in town. I think it could be done in a way to try and help kids appreciate where they live and taking care of it. If we tackle the kids attitudes then eventually it will filter up."
101,"I’ve been a downstairs neighbour to an old semi detached house, with the upstairs neighbours having kids. It just comes with the territory and can’t be helped. We got so used to it that we barely even noticed it lol, but every time we had guests over they’d mention how noisy it was??

Now we’re the upstairs neighbours with a toddler and our first neighbour used to complain non stop. He moved after 6 months and the following neighbours haven’t brought anything up in the last 2 years. Some people are just more high strung than others."
102,Get a bunch of wifi cameras (Tapo/Kasa etc) around your house. Also get a Ring doorbell or point a wifi camera at the front door. Capture a couple of these moments - when you are lounging around and she is coming to your door to complain. That's all the evidence you need. Report her for harassment.
103,"Ginger Pig is really nice, but really expensive too!

They have their own cookbook, but most traditional British cookbooks will have similar recipes. 

BBC good food website have great recipes too:
(https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/scotch-egg-recipes

https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/search?q=Sausage+rolls)"
104,Hackney Bridge Kitchen is really nice for a drink and some food (my favourite being Filligrillz). There's also Here East a few minutes walk that has more bars and a couple eateries. There's also an Axe throwing place there for a fun activity but I've not tried that yet.
105,"> Mr Shahadat now lives in a shared house and has his own room, but said trying to find an affordable home in London was extremely difficult because foreign students don't have the references and pay slips needed to secure a home.

This is for all the racists in the comments. He wasn't squatting with 20 other people to save money but couldn't find anything respectable and within his budget in short time.

Anyone who has tried to find a room in last year knows how difficult the market is and let's avoid making racist remarks.

Edit: for those asking about racists comments, sort by old and look at 2nd n 4th comment. Both insinuating that these students can't afford to live in London when the article makes it clear that finding the accommodation was the issue.

It also somehow ignores the suffering of this student when he clearly stated how ashamed he was in that living situation.

Assuming people are poor just because they come from certain countries and they don't have issues with cramped living conditions when evidence to the contrary is present for both conditions is racist."
106,"There's no central calendar for all London protests - the closest might be TfL's travel weekend travel advice feed/emails which advise if a big protest or event is scheduled to slow traffic or close some roads (although this just tells you that an event is planned, not what the actual event is). 

If you're after specific protests etc then you'll need to follow the causes/pressure groups/ charities etc that relate to \[X\] issue on social media as that's how these things are organised now (so that updates/amendments to timings or location can be disseminated quickly). Smaller/more targeted demonstrations etc are organised via closed groups on FB/WhatsApp/telegram etc - again you need to know someone already in \[X\] group to be invited."
107,"Embrace being single. Make some platonic relationships with the opposite sex and date them meaningfully. Make some FWBs for sexual needs. 

So much better than settling for a relationship with someone which is what you’ll do if you spend too long looking."
108,"£10.40 for a half filled small chicken wrap, crisps, and can of coke. Thought the cashier had double scanned something...

Prompted a Google of their new club and what the pricing was all about, and it turns out they have just dramatically raised prices, apparently due to costs. They no longer serve the salmon and avocado salad because of this, apparently.

Not been in for a long time (and only went in due to lack of options), and will not be returning!"
109,"Even many who get on the home ownership ladder, it’s a battle to keep the home and home ownership is mainly geared towards the financial market to make money and the government having something that they can tax you on."
110,"[http://www.pelttrader.com/](http://www.pelttrader.com/)

More a recommendation for the beer than the food, but the food isn't bad and there isn't anywhere round there for food that I know of that's really worth recommending - at least not that isn't crazy expensive. 

It's not a long walk from where you're talking about to areas with a much wider choice of reasonably priced food. Shoreditch, Old St, Brick Lane, etc."
111,"I gave up on that shit app, literally had 12 ubers cancel in a row on me. and not immediately either, they'd wait minutes before cancelling so i was stuck for an hour waiting thinking one would actually come.

i've never used a more useless app. Even Uber eats is more expensive than all the alternatives. Idk what that companies gameplan is."
112,"you went from 20s to 30s, that's a big filter set

you know how in society people say treat this and that with respect etc ? when it comes to dating all of that is not good enough, you need to cover your bases as much as possible

for a man you get points for

-height

-face+hair

-certain ethnicities will have higher status amongst other ethnicities ( ie French/Swedish/Italian men sound exotic to east European & American women for example)

-status/success level 

-wealth/assets/bank

-muscle mass/body fat%

-communication / sexual compatibility


For women you get points if 

-you won't cause headaches/low maintenance ( little or no male/hoey friends, not abusing man's funds)

-body/looks

-youthfulness/innocence  ( small or no history with other men)

- common interests/hobbies/habits

-certain ethnicities/races more desirable than others
 
-friendliness



If things are hard, just act more feminine to attract more masculine guys. Look and act more like a feminine woman"
113,"Never respond. As soon as you respond that give these stalker creeps the red light to attempt to go further with their fantasy. 

If they push, and you are in public, scream at them to make everyone around you aware of what is going on. 

We aren’t all like that. You deserve to go to the mall and chill."
114,"Just to point out, it is not allowed on London Underground infrastructure to take photographs or video for commercial purposes, personal is OK. Also, taking photographs of people in the UK, who are in public or publicly accessible areas is completely legal, without consent. Sometimes you can find it uncomfortable, but 99 times put of 100 there is a completely innocent reason, like photos of the tube for tourism etc."
115,You don't own a sonos sub do you? I live in an absolutely solid new build block on my own. I hear nothing from neighbours either side and the occasional footsteps upstairs. I am conscious of noise. I have had two shitty notes put through my doors complaining about me stomping around. It made no sense and after the first note I was being uber careful literally tip-toeing around. When the second note came through I was sitting watching a film and had barely moved at all. I've switched off the sub and heard nothing from them since. Looking online it seems to be a common problem and isolation pads etc don't seem to do much - money wasted it seems. If you're gaming etc it may be the same problem....
116,"I’m not dating, but several of my friends still are and it sounds like absolute hell, I think the apps have just depersonalised everything and being the age that we are, maybe our patience for shenanigans isn’t there anymore. Good luck with the recovery!"
117,"I second and third Honour - they have off the rack items.

They now go by ""Skin Two"" but British people don't take to name changes very well so will be known as Honour still for years to come.

The shop is by Waterloo."
118,"I weirdly think a lot of men even though they like you, and they probably genuinely do, find it hard to be honest and commit because they simply don't feel ready to be accountable for all the things that will follow. It seems that most girls will begin to start forcing through all the next stages as quickly as possible, i.e. house, engagement, wedding etc. This stuff is all much more real at 30 than say 20. Men will know this takes them out of the comfort zone and have to start to trade off their own interests to accommodate those things. Men seem to want to take it slower, others could say they're immature. I think men will start to settle faster if the girl is easy going."
119,"Can I ask what part of Asia you're from? I'm gonna assume East Asian here. Unfortunately that does make some dickheads think you're some sort of submissive that needs them in your life.

It sucks that there's people out there like this.

Hopefully because London is so massive, your to weirdo to well balanced interaction ratio will be overwhelmingly to the well balanced side eventually."
120,Many Post Offices will do this as a service for £12. One advantage is the photo gets checked at the time and retaken if it’s not right. That can add several days to the process if you do it yourself and get it wrong. I got my passport in 3 weeks when I used them.
121,"Dating in London can be challenging because of the vast number of people, making it seem like there are endless options. Paradoxically, this abundance can lead to indecision and a sense of always seeking something better. Dating apps are often designed to keep users engaged, not necessarily in successful relationships, which can contribute to the feeling of being perpetually single. They prioritize user retention and monetization, sometimes at the expense of genuine connections.

Joining a club or hobby that aligns with your interests is a great way to break the cycle of endless swiping on dating apps. It allows you to connect with people who share your passions, making it more likely to form meaningful connections that could lead to meeting someone special. It's a refreshing approach to dating that can offer a more genuine and fulfilling experience.

Look at swing dancing or outdooraholics some great people in those communities"

123,"Same here, 35m in IT. I am a migrant new-ish to the UK. Used to WFH all the time, but got a new job to work in the office in London one day a week. I though it would be a nice opportunity for me to meet some people, but it turned out that they are either as passive as me or have got their families so are not very active outside work. 

It’s not too bad that I am not living alone. It’s not difficult to meet an acquaintance, but as we have left school for many years, it’s very hard to meet someone with similar background and interests who you guys can meet often. ??"
124,"Quite a few years ago when I was single I would get a very VERY occasional cold approach and in my opinion i found them very flattering, and for the most part, not creepy. There was only one creepy guy who wouldn't leave me alone when I told him I wouldn't give him my number, but as long as you're friendly, kind and respectful I think you should be ok. It takes absolutely huge massive floor-scraping balls to confidently just cold approach people so hats off to ya. Just stay prepared for a fair bit of rejection unfortunately :(

&#x200B;

On the other side of things there were a few times I got little train / tube crushes before I met my bf and really wanted to approach them (I didn't!). One of them sat right next to me on a empty platform, and then I sat opposite him on an empty tube carriage. He didn't look at me much - i leaned over to talk to say hello and caught my reflection in the window and i looked a mess (and im very unconfident generally) so decided against it. Anyway, if you think someone might be wanting to talk to you just make good eye contact and smile, put your phone away? Idk it entirely depends on how confident the woman is feeling."
125,"I encountered minimal ghosting as well because I am very selective on personality and can read well but decent women were a minority.

I am below average in look and grinded never giving up until I found my girlfriend, by far the best one I have ever had.

I was not expecting to like her so much in the beginning but because through apps is hard to tell and to showcase yourself.

I found her by chance, we are the exception that proves the rule: apps are shit and you need to work overtime and be lucky to find someone good for you.

Advice for men: learn from your mistakes and never give up.

If a hot woman has matched with you and you are average or below she's probably a scammer or one looking for a free meal.

Advice for women: if you want a good man, look for it, you can't rely on luck and him falling from the sky next to you. Put effort and even for you no pain, no gain.

If a hot man has matched with you and you are average or below he's probably a fuckboy."
126,"It is true. Not everyday is happening something, but at least once per week for sure. Even though I consider the underground being more dodgy and full of freaks. At least the bus line I am using is not overcrowded usually."
127,"Dating apps commodify relationships as a consumer good and we react to that as we do when looking for consumer goods, unconsciously start treating dating like picking a tv or a new car. We tend to have a set of ‘features’ in our head we want and we are shopping for the best product for our needs rather than attempting to cultivate a relationship with another person. It means we are more picky about things we see on the surface and less interested in the deeper stuff.

We also tend to put in less effort. When you are shopping for a good you’re not trying to impress *it*, you want it to impress *you*. So we give less and expect more. 

Apps encourage us to treat each other like picking a new lamp at ikea and then have us wondering why we feel like we are both being evaluated and evaluating others like a product.

They can be good and helpful, but you have to be aware that dating apps are designed to do the above and consciously resist those instincts.

Hooray for capitalism!"
128,"Go onto rightmove, search to buy from embankment station (the closest to the centre of London), start expanding the search area until something I like turns up.  


But with 10 million? I wouldn't go for London, I'd move somewhere of outstanding natural beauty near a good pub and mountains. Peak District/Lake District etc.  


Or a castle..."
129,"I think there are a few reasons:

1) women under 30 are choosers. Men after 30 are choosers. Dynamics change substantially.
2) Commoditization. When you can swipe hundreds of profiles in an hour, it has an impact..
3) Men are tired. As a man, you consistently have to prove something and show your best to just have a chance. Is he dressed well,what are the manners, was hi funny, did he do/didn't do x,y,z? 
4) Idiots being influenced by Andrew Tate and the likes . These are weaklings who try to pretend to be an alpha so they try to do it by throwing insults towards women."
130,"Once you’re oversensitised to sound it can drive you into serious and dangerous mental illness. Its happened to me. I could never live in the same building as other people now. Luckily I don’t have to but my blood runs cold thinking about the pain I know your neighbour is in. 

If you are genuinely not being loud (have you asked her exactly what she’s hearing and tried to mitigate it?) there isn’t anything you can do. Your neighbour will have to recognise that she can‘t cope in this living situation and get some practical and spycholgical help."
131,"A guy tried to snatch my phone on Saturday, I was walking down a pretty quiet residential road in a nice part of Bermondsey. He grabbed my (month old) iphone, but I only managed to hold on because I was using a loop phone holder. A 90p thing saved me a grand replacing my phone!"
132,"I know its pure chaos but Dalston High Street literally has everything you could ever want in a ten min radius - loads of cheap cuisine options, fancy wine bars, solid cheap pubs, roof gardens, curve garden, coffee, charity shops, DIY, clubs, cinemas ... everything

Just need to learn to navigate the crazy (but friendly) crowd and you're good to go"
133,"Where I am, the communal bins for the building are out on the street, so they're used by passers-by, the council's street cleaners, and some folks even make a special trip by car to dump their rubbish.

Bins were collected twice a week - just enough to keep on top of it - till the council changed hands last year. Spent months complaining to the new council about overflowing bins, missed collections, rubbish piling up on the streets, rubbish left strewn around by the collection crews, etc. We've since had some weeks where we've had two collections on a Monday, and then additional collections on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, which seems like a bit of a waste of resources."
134,"Get an old phone and download a decibal recorder app, having it running at her peak times of when you are noisy and then you have evidence you aren't being noisy to show to the police when you make a harassment complaint"
135,"I think it’s 15 tokens for £5-7 and it’s 1-2 per machine. 

The consoles were free if you could get on them. 
Cocktails were about £11-£12 and you’ll need to pay £5 if going in after 10pm on a Friday.

It’s quite a mix of people. I’ve been in a few NQ64’s and you have some very casual dressed, relaxed people and some who are dressed for a full night out.

Music is quite loud and it’s quite dark inside but it’s fun for a visit for a few hours."
136,"I think I was very lucky. I was in a small studio and was having a chat with my landlord just before the second lockdown and he asked if I was happy and I said honestly after lockdown I think I want a bigger space and a cat for company.

He was like you can have a cat... and I have a 1 bed flat free in two months. 

Two months later I moved in, a week later got a cat."
137,"The second text-based test is far superior to existing and uses the screen far more effectively. Not sure I get the first test. What are those purple lines with crosses even depicting? And, before you tell me, why would the average person know or have the time to work it out?"

149,"I have heard from it like maybe once.
Hidalgo is not a popular figure among Parisians, to say the least.
I've noticed more trees (which is nice), less cars, more bikes.
I am a pedestrian and won't ever ride a bike again in Paris (too dangerous), so these changes are quite neutral to me. People on bikes can be more dangerous than people in cars.
Hidalgo banned self-service electric scooters for that reason.
Otherwise the changes are quite subtle, Paris was already a walkable city before them. It affects commuters a lot more. From what I understand, having less cars in Paris is nice for Parisians, not so much for people in the suburbs since getting to Paris by car is more difficult, and since traffic jams are now deported in the suburbs.

Will have to wait until the Olympics to see how it plays out.

I can't say if it has made Paris more livable, but I feel like there are more urgent things to do than put bike lanes everywhere. However, planning for global warming (as Hidalgo is doing) is quite welcome, Paris becomes a living hell during the heatwaves."

Idem pour les logements j'ai connu des locations de 20m2 a 900€ et des 45m2 dans le même quartier au même prix pour des constructions de qualité similaire.

It's known for being a bit of a party school. Because it costs quite a lot of money (for european standards), most people come from rich families who are looking to have a fun college experience in Paris and don't really take studying seriously. From what I heard, not many of them really learn how to speak French properly because they all just stick with English. Also more girls than guys if that matters to you. 

Two of the four people didn't even stay all four years. They quickly transfered to different French unis.

One other criticism is that the Uni doesn't really offer that much in terms of different majors. Atleast, that was the case when I was accepted back in 2015.

J’ai parfaitement haï la Défense par d’autres côtés, mon principal grief étant la bouffe. Mauvaise et excessivement chère, même le McDo est imbouffable, c’est une honte. Le second étant le vent en hiver.

Petite pensée pour le bar du Renaissance où on a payé je pense environ un tiers de ce qu’on devait, trois à quatre soirs par semaine, pendant quatre ans, sans même le savoir. Jusqu’à ce qu’un jour la gestion change et que les serveurs s’excusent à notre arrivée de devoir nous faire tout payer “à partir de maintenant”. Naïfs qu’on était, on a dit pas de souci. 200 balles par tête plus tard, c’est la dernière fois qu’on s’est bourré la gueule là-bas.

Or les stats sont faites sur toute la journée..(en gros hors heure de pointe c'est tjr bon donc ça améliore les stats)
Et excluent tous les éléments extérieurs (d'après la SNCF) qui interfèrent sur leur volonté/envie/objectif d'être a l'heure = incident voyageur, train devant qui ralentit ou correspondance dans une gare qui est un pôle d'échange entre plusieurs lignes.
Moi qui voyage presque quotidiennement en TER c'est pareil.
Je trouve le service plutôt correct. Mais dès que il y a un train court alors qu'on est 100mille ou qu'ils sont en retour et que je rate ma correspondance a Versailles ça me fout la haine..
Ya un groupe twitter, fb etc qui regroupe les usagers donc rejoins celui de la ligne J.
Comme je te dis,  le ressenti sera à pondérer avec les stats qu'ils partagent et tu te feras ton avis. 
Bon courage !"

202,"Je te conseille de regarder pour une coloc, même avec des inconnus. Quand je suis arrivé à Paris, j'ai fait ça et c'est moins cher que de se loger seul. Perso, je suis bien tombé et mes colocataires étaient sympa, mais j'avoue qu'il vaut peut être mieux les rencontrer avant.

J'étais en banlieue proche (Vincennes), et je payais beaucoup moins cher que ce que j'ai pu trouver en studio seul.

204,"J'y ai travaillé pendant 3 ans.. c'était.. mixte: j'ai beaucoup apprécié mes collègues de l'époque (qui sont devenus des amis) du coup j'ai des souvenirs sympas de l'époque. Mais je me rappelle bien de l'aspect ""cube de sucre"" quand je sortais du métro le matin, deguisé dans mes vêtements de ""corporate"" (costume, chemise, cravate les mauvais jours) entouré de plein de personnes portant le même déguisement... bref c'est très normé, oppressant. J'étais tellement plus heureux d'aller dans mon job suivant dans le 13eme arrondissement, en vélo, dans un bâtiment adjacent à la BNF et à la Seine, avec un dress code beaucoup plus relax...

Le week-end par contre, la défense est un endroit très sympa, et je continue à y retrouver des amis de temps en temps. L'aspect sans voiture est très agréable, et la composition architecturale est vraiment réussie. Parmis tous les nouveaux quartiers que j'ai vu en région parisienne, je crois que c'est celui que j'apprécie de plus ."

210,"Je crois pas que c’est spécifique aux Français, le manque de civisme et l’attitude “je suis seul-e au monde je fais ce que je veux”. Mais quand même. 


J’étais à l’aéroport y’a une semaine et j’attendais mon chum. J’avais une valise, je rentrais également à MTL, mais pas de la même destination fak j’attendais à la sortie avec une valise. J’ai un casque anti-bruit, j’écoute de la musique, et y’a un tata à côté qui FaceTime quelqu’un avec le son à fond et en criant (parce que bon, y’a du bruit). A tel point que ça me dérange en train d’écouter de la musique. Je lui demande poliment s’il a pas un casque et il dit non, que si je suis pas contente, je peux retourner en France (avec son gros accent français). Sur le coup j’ai même pas compris… je me suis retrouvée dans une embrouille sans même savoir de quoi il parlait, j’étais comme “c’est quoi le rapport??” et il s’énervait tout seul… il est parti et j’étais comme “the fuck just happened??”


Alors, ouin, basé sur cette anecdote je me dis que quand même, y’a un problème avec les Français. Mais je suis en Montérégie et hier soir y’avait des voisins qui mettaient de la musique beaucoup trop forte, d’autres personnes qui ont apparemment appelé la police, et ce matin y’avait des détritus dans la rue (super résidentiel, que des maisons avec arbres et cours bien entretenues là, ça fait des années que je suis là et j’ai jamais vu les rues sales…)


Bref je sais pas si les Français sont pires"
211,"Personnellement, les boutiques de prêt sur gage ne seraient pas l’option qui me viendrait à l’esprit en premier. Je ne sais pas si c’est pareil partout, mais les rares fois où j’ai visité une telle boutique, il y avait soit des instruments cheap tout droit sorti d’Ali Express, soit du matériel de marques réputées, mais bien trop cher.

Un des problèmes majeurs avec les prêteurs sur gage, c’est qu’ils chargent les taxes. Dans le meilleur des cas, le prix avant taxe sera identique à ce que l’on trouve en achetant à un particulier. Et aussi, les employés ne s’y connaissent généralement pas en guitare et ne sauront pas te conseiller ou répondre à des questions techniques.

Je pense que le mieux, c’est de chercher des annonces sur Kijiji ou Marketplace pour trouver les meilleurs prix. Peut-être que certains magasins de guitares/d’instruments de musique vendent aussi des instruments d’occasion. Malheureusement je n’en connais pas à Montréal."

I moved back to Quebec in 2020 and am on the waiting list with not much hope for getting a family doctor any time soon. A few weeks ago, a friend went to the ER with chest pains and it took her 26 hours to actually be seen.

""ya de la construction partout, j'arrive pas à me déplacer boooo""

Choose one. The infrastructure in Montréal is old and needs repairs. Alternatively, we can let everything fall apart. I prefer the construction."
217,"Pretty sure it doesn’t only happen in Montreal. This shit has been increasing over time thanks to how comfortable we’ve become and glued on our devices. I think technology plays a part in that, but also selfishness and the lack of respect. You see it in situations like:

-When you’re about to get off the metro, you see a bunch of people not making space or be patient enough for you to leave first. They think it’s fine to just come right in, not knowing/caring if someone’s getting out.

-When taking the automatic stairs, there’s always people taking all the place when you’re trying go up faster because you’re in a hurry or generally walk faster. Some are so unaware/careless that they think they can just take all the place and block you from passing by. It’s important to know that there are 2 invisible lanes in the stairs: to your left side, it’s for people who are not in a hurry, just wanna chill there and wait to go up. To your right side, it’s for those who wanna go up faster or are in a hurry. It’s simple.

-In buses, I’ve noticed a recurrent pattern (especially in larger STM buses). When there’s an agglomeration of people in the bus, somehow, people are afraid or feel awkward to go in the back. Therefore, it creates this gap in the middle of the bus as almost empty and as well in the back. However, in front, it’s packed It seems that some people are so afraid or feel awkward to say “excuse me” to go further in the back so the new comers can have enough space to even walk in the bus. Then, it’s another story on top of that when you voice out that you wanna leave or move when they’re glued and have their headphones on, completely disconnected of their environment.

Literal spatial awareness, respect and common sense are the minimum, I believe, to have a pleasant moment when commuting or anywhere else in the city."
218,"People live only in their own realities now, the phone pocket pc has dumbed us down into a massive consumer machine n it’s all anyone cares about. Nobody has any memory capacity, just refer to the phone.

Jews for literal millennia have relied on being extra pre-cautious as a way to ensure they survive.

Clearly the people brushing this off  have no idea what dealing with pogroms constantly for centuries from every country.

233,"Ah yes, the leftist and progressive view of supporting the side that raped women and paraded their bodies around the city.

There is nothing progressive or leftist of supporting a government that wants Sharia law. Homosexuality is still illegal in Gaza. Women cannot apply for divorce unless they can prove abuse, men can ask and it is granted. 

The people of Palestine deserve our support, so long as they are not supporters of Hamas. But claiming you care about Palestine and defending Hamas is like saying you care about North Koreans and defending Kim Jong Un."

As for technical training, most, if not all, require equipment that is usually quite expensive and specialized teachers with knowledge and experience that cannot be found in books.

Il n’y a pas vraiment de tissus faits au Québec, ce qui est fait ici c’est quelques sortes de jersey de coton, lin, bambou avec possibilité de faire imprimer ton motif mais ça revient à minimum 20$ du mètre si tu commandes une quantité faramineuse. Un t-shirt prend environ un mètre et tu n’as pas encore commencé à payer la personne qui le coud. Les couturières qui ont leur atelier vont te charger environ 30-35$ de l’heure si t’es chanceux. Dans des plus grosses entreprises de couture tu peux trouver des bons prix mais elles sont rares et mon dieu que c’est mal géré. Retards de production, dépassement de coûts constants, manque de liquidités pour payer les employés, faillites, name it.
Je connais des filles incroyables qui font des petites productions 100% local mais pour faire leur argent elles doivent vendre cher et personne est prêt à payer. Pas quand H&M vend des t-shirts à 10$.

Amsterdam wasn't designed to cater to bicycles. First of all, it was founded in the 12th century, hundreds of years before bicycles.

Secondly, it had car centric infrastructure dominance just like the rest of Europe and North America until the people who *lived there* realized that depending on cars made living there shit, and decided to pursue alternatives, which Montreal is doing right now.

>And don’t tell me I could use public transit to get into the city. If Montreal and the suburbs had anywhere near the adequate, functional and competent public transit system like NY, France or Tokyo, I would be on it right now. But as it stands, it’s not a viable option.

So what you're arguing for is, instead of creating better transit to get from outside the city to downtown, to not do that at all and instead make the city worse for the people who live in it in favour of the people who do not."
267,"C’est drole que les gens dans les commentaires ont fixé sur le
« j’ai un peu une grande geule » au lieu des situations. Je ne peux pas me prononcer sur la réaction des français à être interpelés mais je peux dire que les situations que tu a décrites (sauf celle du chat) j’en ai vécu des très similaires avec des français..j’ai souvent l’impression qu’il y a un manque de « self awareness » beaucoup d’eux ne semble pas comprendre l’espace qu’ils prennent."
268,"Sorry for your experience, but working out is very important to those of us who do it and sometimes it just has to be at a specific hour because no other times work. He's probably doing it before going to work in the morning and doesn't have any other time to do it."
269,"i used it multiple times before the membership, before covid. it worked fine back then, id get an appointment the same day for 7$, saw a doctor and got my issue resolved quickly... was convenient, I guess it doesn't seem to work anymore and the membership is bullshit"
270,"Doesn’t apply in Mtl, because the blue car would be stopped in the middle of the the road. I would be in the red car, stuck trying to turn right while the left turning blue car awaits oncoming traffic to pass"
271,"What all are you buying? Could be ways to trim it back. I like Food Hero. Let's you buy nearly expired stuff (all frozen, so it's fine) 
Also if you can cut up your own meat (ie buy a roast and make it into steaks/porkchops etc) 
Look at what's on sale, base what you make on that, stock up on pantry staples when cheap, make your own juice, don't shop at the bougie grocery store if you are"
272,"Nah fuck them. Just keep wearing your earphones. It's what I do. I got a warning by some butthurt cop mad that he is forced to stand in front of a school and direct kids across streets. Stopped me and told me if he sees me again with them in, he'll give me a ticket. 

So I kept biking past him with my earphones in. The fuck is he gonna do. Leave his super important post, waddle to his car and chase me down? Lul"
273,"It's not just a Montreal thing, it's just a people thing in general.

If you've lived in smaller cities or towns, then you're probably not used to the amount of people a big city like Montreal has.  Toronto is the same way, so is Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, and most of the major cities suburbs too.

If you've lived in one of those places and have seen a vast difference from there and Montreal, then I don't know what to tell you, because I've lived in almost every single one of them and encountered it regularly there."
274,"In my opinion here are some of my favorite things.

Places to see: Mont Royal, St Paul Street, Plateau, St Denis, Notre Dame Basilica, Atwater Market

Food: Rockaberry (mountain sized pieces of cheesecake), Green Spot (amazing smoked meat, burgers and poutine), Lloydies (Carribean food), Gibeau Orange Julep/ Arthurs Nosh Bar (I havent had either before but I've heard they are great), Crew Collective Cafe (beautiful cafe)

Theres also a number of hip speakeasies in the city including Atwater club (only one Ive been to)"
275,"I don't always eat constantly at home so it can be hard to say, but approximately 11$/ day. I don't buy as much in bulk as I use to since it's even harder to pass everything.


So buying in bulk is a start and shop sales. Freeze food if you must.


If you have access to a ""fruiterie"" nearby, go check them out. Mine is always equal in price or cheaper for quality equal or better. I only buy fruits and vegetables in normal groceries store when I'm already there and just need one or two thing.


Water is free to drink. Coffee and tea are cheap."
276,"Agree with the coroner here. Alcohol is part of society and being able to have one beer or one glass of wine at an event is not the cause of all these accidents.  Zero tolerance is a joke. Have a beer at 6 pm, not sure if you can drive at midnight. Makes no sense. 

What they should do is add more teeth to the sentencing."
277,"hey all, heading to your city next weekend (Oct 20-22). Were staying near Shaughnessy Village and looking to go out dancing with an older crowd, preferably not EDM or Metal or RAP. It seems like its a real crapshoot on whats a good spot on where to go. Any insight on what would be a good spot for us to go? (were 35+). Doesn't need to be walking distance. Thanks ahead!"
278,"If you're surviving on 250$ per month and are not eating out (something you haven't mentionned), you're doing great.

The money waste on food is not normally on groceries, assuming you shop deals or mostly go to Walmarts-Maxis-SuperCs, it's the ""occasionnal"" takeout or restaurant that becomes a habit"
